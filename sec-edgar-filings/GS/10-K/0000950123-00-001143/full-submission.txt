<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking and
securities firm that provides a wide range of services worldwide
to a substantial and diversified client base that includes
corporations, financial institutions, governments and
high-net-worth individuals. As of November&nbsp;26, 1999, we
operated offices in over 20 countries and 37% of our 15,361
employees were based outside the United States.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman Sachs is the successor to a commercial paper business
founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman. Since then, we have expanded
our business as a participant and intermediary in securities and
other financial activities to become one of the leading firms in
the industry.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1989, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. was formed to serve as the
 parent company of the Goldman Sachs organization. On May&nbsp;7,
 1999, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. succeeded to the business of
 The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and completed an initial public
offering of its common stock.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All references to 1999, 1998 and 1997 refer to our fiscal year
ended, or the date, as the context requires, November&nbsp;26,
1999, November&nbsp;27, 1998 and November&nbsp;28, 1997,
respectively.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When we use the terms &#147;Goldman Sachs&#148;, &#147;we&#148;
and &#147;our&#148;, we mean, prior to our conversion to
corporate form, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., a Delaware limited
 partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries and, after our
conversion to corporate form, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Financial information concerning our business segments and
geographic regions for each of 1999, 1998 and 1997 is set forth
in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in
 our 1999 Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated
by reference in Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report
on Form&nbsp;10-K.

Investment Banking represented 33% of 1999 net revenues. We
provide a broad range of investment banking services to a diverse
 group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and
individuals and seek to develop and maintain long-term
relationships with these clients as their lead investment bank.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our current structure, which is organized along regional, product
 and industry groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment
bankers with execution and industry expertise. Because our
businesses are global, we have adapted our organization to meet
the demands of our clients in each geographic region. Through our
 commitment to teamwork, we believe that we provide services in
an integrated fashion for the benefit of our clients.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B><I>Underwriting.</I></B> We underwrite a wide range of
securities and other instruments, including common and preferred
stock, convertible securities, investment-grade debt, high-yield
debt, sovereign and emerging markets debt, municipal debt, bank
loans, asset-backed securities and real estate-related
securities, such as mortgage-backed securities and the securities
 of real estate investment trusts.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Equity Underwriting.</I> Equity underwriting has been a
long-term core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers and
acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in winning
mandates for large, complex equity underwritings. We believe our
leadership in large initial public offerings reflects our
expertise in complex transactions, research strengths, track
record and distribution capabilities. We have also acted as lead
manager on many of the largest initial public offerings in the
international arena.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We believe that a key factor in our equity underwriting success
is the close working relationship among the investment bankers,
research analysts and sales force as coordinated by our Equity
Capital Markets group. With institutional sales professionals and
 high-net-worth relationship managers located in every major
market around the world, Goldman Sachs has relationships with a
large and diverse group of investors.

Trading and Principal Investments represented 43% of 1999 net
revenues. Our Trading and Principal Investments business
facilitates transactions with a diverse group of corporations,
financial institutions, governments and individuals and takes
proprietary positions through market making in and trading of
fixed income and equity products, currencies, commodities, and
swaps and other derivatives. In order to meet the needs of our
clients, our Trading and Principal Investments business is
diversified across a wide range of products. For example, we make
 markets in traditional investment-grade debt securities,
structure complex derivatives and securitize mortgages and
insurance risk. We believe our willingness and ability to take
risk distinguishes us and substantially enhances our client
relationships.

We generate trading net revenues from our customer-driven
business in three ways. First, in large, highly liquid markets,
we undertake a high volume of transactions for modest spreads.
Second, by capitalizing on our strong market relationships and
capital position, we also undertake transactions in less liquid
markets where spreads are generally larger. Finally, we generate
net revenues from structuring and executing transactions that
address complex client needs.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In our proprietary activities, we assume a variety of risks and
devote substantial resources to identify, analyze and benefit
from these exposures. We leverage our strong research
capabilities and capitalize on our proprietary analytical models
to analyze information and make informed trading judgments. We
seek to benefit from perceived disparities in the value of assets
 in the trading markets and from macroeconomic and
company-specific trends.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FICC uses a three-part approach to deliver high quality service
to its clients. First, we offer broad market making, research and
 market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. Second, we
create innovative solutions to complex client problems by drawing
 upon our structuring and trading expertise. Third, we use our
expertise to take positions in markets when we believe the return
 is at least commensurate with the risk.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A core activity in FICC is market making in a broad array of
securities and products. For example, we are a primary dealer in
many of the largest government bond markets around the world,
including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and
Canada. We are a member of the major futures exchanges, and also
have interbank dealer status in the currency markets in New York,
 London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Our willingness to make markets in
a broad range of fixed income, currency and commodity products
and their derivatives is crucial both to our client relationships
 and to support our underwriting business by providing secondary
market liquidity. Our research capabilities include quantitative
and qualitative analyses of global economic, currency and
financial market trends, as well as credit analyses of corporate
and sovereign fixed income securities.

are recorded in Asset Management and Securities Services.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In equity trading, as in FICC, we generate net revenues from our
customer-driven business in three ways. First, in large, highly
liquid principal markets, such as the over-the-counter market for
 equity securities, we undertake a high volume of transactions
for modest spreads. Second, by capitalizing on our strong market
relationships and capital position, we also undertake large
transactions, such as block trades and positions in securities,
in which we benefit from spreads that are generally larger.
Finally, we also benefit from structuring complex transactions.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman Sachs was a pioneer and is currently active in the
execution of large block trades (trades of 50,000 or more shares)
 in the United States and abroad. We have been able to capitalize
 on our expertise in block trading, our global distribution
network and our willingness to commit capital to effect
increasingly large and complex customer transactions. We expect
corporate consolidation and restructuring and increased demand
for certainty and speed of execution by sellers and issuers of
securities to increase both the frequency and size of sales of
large blocks of equity securities. Block transactions, however,
expose us to increased risks, including those arising from
holding large and concentrated positions, and decreasing spreads.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are active in the listed options and futures markets, and we
structure, distribute and execute over-the-counter derivatives on
 market indices, industry groups and individual company stocks to
 facilitate customer transactions and our proprietary activities.
 We develop quantitative strategies and render advice with
respect to portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset
allocation transactions. We also create specially tailored
instruments to enable sophisticated investors to undertake
hedging strategies and establish or liquidate investment
positions. We are one of the leading participants in the trading
and development of equity derivative instruments. We are an
active participant in the trading of futures and options on most
of the major exchanges in the United States, Europe and Asia.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We remain committed to being at the forefront of technological
innovation in the global capital markets. To pursue our strategy
of expanding our electronic market-making capabilities, on
September&nbsp;24, 1999, Goldman Sachs completed its acquisition
of The Hull Group, a leading global electronic market maker in
exchange-traded equity derivatives and an active market maker in
equity securities worldwide.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition, equity arbitrage has long been an important part of
our equity franchise. Our strategy is based on making investments
 on a global basis through a diversified portfolio across
different markets and event categories. This business focuses on
event-oriented special situations where we are not acting as an
advisor and on relative value trades. These special situations
include mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings,
recapitalizations and legal and regulatory events.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B><I>Trading Risk Management.</I></B> We believe that our
trading and market-making capabilities are key ingredients to our
 success. While these businesses have generally earned attractive
 returns, we have in the past incurred significant trading losses
 in periods of market turbulence, such as in 1994 and the second
half of 1998.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our trading risk management process seeks to balance our ability
to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential
losses. Risk management includes input from all levels of Goldman
 Sachs, from the trading desks to the Firmwide Risk Committee.

procedures, see &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and

<B><I>Principal Investments.</I></B> In connection with our
merchant banking activities, we invest by making principal
investments directly and through funds that we raise and manage.
As of November&nbsp;1999, we had committed $3.06 billion, of
which $2.33 billion had been funded, of the $17.27 billion total
equity capital committed for our merchant banking funds. The
funds&#146; investments generate capital appreciation or
depreciation and, upon disposition, realized gains or losses. See

Services&nbsp;&#151; Merchant Banking&#148; for a discussion of
our merchant banking funds. As of November 1999, the aggregate
carrying value of our principal investments held directly or
through our merchant banking funds was approximately $2.88
billion, which consisted of corporate principal investments with
an aggregate carrying value of approximately $1.95 billion and
real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of
approximately $928 million.

Goldman Sachs is seeking to build a premier global asset
management business. We offer a broad array of investment
strategies and advice across all major asset classes: global
equity; fixed income, including money markets; currency; and
alternative investment products (<I>i.e.</I>, investment vehicles
 with non-traditional investment objectives and/or strategies).
Assets under supervision consist of assets under management and
other client assets. Assets under management typically generate
fees based on a percentage of their value and include our mutual
funds, separate accounts managed for institutional and individual
 investors, our merchant banking funds and other alternative
investment funds. Other client assets consist of assets in
brokerage accounts of primarily high-net-worth individuals, on
which we earn commissions.

</TABLE>

<P align="left"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Merchant Banking</I></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman Sachs has established a successful record in the
corporate and real estate merchant banking business, with
$17.27&nbsp;billion of committed capital as of
November&nbsp;1999, of which $13.03&nbsp;billion has been funded.
 We have committed $3.06&nbsp;billion and funded
$2.33&nbsp;billion of these amounts. Our clients, including
pension plans, endowments, charitable institutions and
high-net-worth individuals, have provided the remainder.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our strategy with respect to each merchant banking fund is to
invest opportunistically to build a portfolio of investments that
 is diversified by industry, product type, geographic region and
transaction structure and type. Some of these investment funds
pursue, on a global basis, long-term investments in equity and
debt securities in privately negotiated transactions, leveraged
buyouts and acquisitions. As of November&nbsp;1999, our corporate
 merchant banking funds had total committed capital of
$9.50&nbsp;billion. Other funds, with total committed capital of
$7.77&nbsp;billion as of November&nbsp;1999, invest in real
estate operating companies and debt and equity interests in real
estate assets.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Merchant banking activities generate three revenue streams.
First, we receive a management fee that is generally a percentage
 of a fund&#146;s committed capital, invested capital, total
gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual management
fees are included in our Asset Management revenues. Second, after
 that fund has achieved a minimum return for fund investors, we
receive an increased share of the fund&#146;s income and gains
that is a percentage, typically 20%, of the capital appreciation
and gains from the fund&#146;s investments. Revenues from the
increased share of the funds&#146; income and gains are included
in Commissions. Finally, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor
 in these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the
funds&#146; unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from
changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon
realization. These items are included in the Trading and
Principal Investments component of Global Capital Markets.

<P align="left"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Securities Services</I></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Securities Services consists predominantly of Global Securities
Services, which provides prime brokerage, financing services and
securities lending to a diversified U.S. and international

customer base, including hedge funds, pension funds and
high-net-worth individuals. Securities Services also includes our
 matched book businesses.
</DIV>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We offer prime brokerage services to our clients, allowing them
the flexibility to trade with most brokers while maintaining a
single source for financing and portfolio reports. Our prime
brokerage activities provide multi-product clearing and custody
in 50 markets, consolidated multi-currency accounting and
reporting and offshore fund administration and also provide
servicing for our most active clients. Additionally, we provide
financing to our clients through margin loans collateralized by
securities held in the client&#146;s account.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Securities lending activities principally involve the borrowing
and lending of equity securities to cover customer and Goldman
Sachs&#146; short sales and to finance Goldman Sachs&#146; long
positions. In addition, we are an active participant in the
securities lending broker-to-broker business and the third-party
agency lending business.

<P align="left"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commissions</I></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman Sachs generates commissions by executing agency
transactions on major stock and futures exchanges worldwide. We
effect agency transactions for clients located throughout the
world. In recent years, aggregate commissions have increased as a
 result of growth in transaction volume on the major exchanges.
As discussed above, Commissions also includes the increased share
 of income and gains from merchant banking funds as well as
commissions earned from brokerage transactions. For a discussion
regarding our increased share of the income and gains from our
merchant banking funds, see &#147;&#151;&nbsp;Merchant
Banking&#148; above.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In anticipation of continued growth in electronic connectivity
and on-line trading, Goldman Sachs has made strategic investments
 in alternative trading systems to gain experience and
participate in the development of this market. See
&#147;&#151;&nbsp;Internet Strategy&#148; below for a further
discussion of these investments.

<P align="left"><B>Global Investment Research</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our Global Investment Research Department provides fundamental
research on economies, debt and equity markets, commodities
markets, industries and companies on a worldwide basis. For over
two decades, we have committed resources on a global scale to
develop a leading position in the industry for our investment
research products.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of
November 1999 provided research coverage of approximately 2,400

<P align="left"><B>Internet Strategy</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We believe that Internet technology and electronic commerce will,
 over time, change the ways that securities and other financial
products are traded and distributed, creating both opportunities
and challenges for our businesses. In response, we have
established a program of internal development and external
investment.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Internally, we are extending our global electronic trading and
information distribution capabilities to our clients via the
Internet. These capabilities cover many of our fixed income,
currency, commodity, equities and mutual fund products in markets
 around the world. We are also using the Internet to improve the
ease and quality of communication with our institutional and
high-net-worth clients. For example, investors have on-line
access to our investment research, mutual fund data and valuation
 models. In addition, our high-net-worth clients are increasingly
 accessing their portfolio information over the Internet. We have
 also recently established GS-Online<SUP>SM</SUP>, which, in
conjunction with Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co., acts as an
underwriter of securities offerings via the Internet and other
electronic means. GS-Online<SUP>SM</SUP> will deal initially only
 with other underwriters and syndicate members and not with
members of the public.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recently, we established an internal working group to focus
primarily on utilizing the Internet to enhance and support our
wealth management business. Externally, we have invested in
electronic commerce concerns such as Bridge Information Systems,
Inc., TradeWeb LLC, Archipelago, L.L.C., The BRASS Utility,
L.L.C., OptiMark Technologies, Inc. and Wit Capital Group, Inc.
Through these investments, we gain an increased understanding of
business developments and opportunities in this emerging sector.

<P align="left"><B>Information Technology</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Technology is fundamental to our overall business strategy.
Goldman Sachs is committed to the ongoing development,
maintenance and use of technology throughout the organization. We
 have developed significant software and systems over the past
several years. Our technology initiatives can be broadly
categorized into three efforts:

</TABLE>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have tailored our services to our clients by providing them
with electronic access to our products and services. For example,
 we developed the <I>GS Financial Workbench<SUP>SM</SUP></I>, an
Internet Web site that clients and employees can use to download
research reports, access earnings and valuation models, submit
trades, monitor accounts, build and view presentations, calculate
 derivative prices and view market data. First made available in
1995, the <I>GS Financial Workbench<SUP>SM</SUP></I> represents a
 joint effort among all of our business areas to create one
comprehensive site for clients and employees to access our
products and services.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have also developed software that enables us to monitor and
analyze our market and credit risks. This risk management
software not only analyzes market risk on firmwide, divisional
and trading desk levels, but also breaks down our risk into its
underlying exposures, permitting management to evaluate exposures
 on the basis of specific interest rate, currency rate, equity
price or commodity price changes. To assist further in the
management of our credit exposures, data from many sources are
aggregated daily into credit management systems that give senior
management and professionals in the Credit and Controllers
departments the ability to receive timely information with
respect to credit exposures worldwide, including netting
information, and the ability to analyze complex risk situations
effectively. Our software accesses this data, allows

for quick analysis at the level of individual trades and
interacts with other Goldman Sachs systems.
</DIV>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Technology has also been a significant factor in improving the
overall efficiency of many areas of Goldman Sachs. By automating
many trading procedures and operational and accounting processes,
 we have substantially increased our efficiency and accuracy.

<P align="left"><B>Employees</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Management believes that one of the strengths and principal
reasons for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and
dedication of its people and the shared sense of being part of a
team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters
professionalism, excellence, diversity and cooperation among our
employees worldwide.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a
continuous process, in which training plays an important part.
All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in
education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various
locations throughout the world. Another important part of
instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review
process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and
employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is
integral to our team approach.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As of November&nbsp;1999, we had 15,361 employees, which excludes
 employees of Goldman Sachs&#146; two property management
subsidiaries. Substantially all of the costs of these property
management employees are reimbursed to Goldman Sachs by the real
estate investment funds to which these subsidiaries provide
property management services.

<P align="left"><B>Competition</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The financial services industry&nbsp;&#151; and all of our
businesses&nbsp;&#151; are intensely competitive, and we expect
them to remain so. Our competitors are other brokers and dealers,
 investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment
advisors, mutual funds, hedge funds, commercial banks and
merchant banks. We compete with some of our competitors globally
and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Our
competition is based on a number of factors, including
transaction execution, our products and services, innovation,
reputation and price.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining
qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete
effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to
attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing
employees.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and
convergence among companies in the financial services industry.
In particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance
companies and other broad-based financial services firms have
established or acquired broker-dealers or have merged with other
financial institutions. Many of these firms have the ability to
offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit taking and
insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking
services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also
 have the ability to support investment banking and securities
products with commercial banking, insurance and other financial
services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could
result in pricing pressure in our businesses.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recently enacted federal financial modernization legislation
significantly expands the activities permissible for firms
affiliated with a U.S. bank. The legislation, among other things,
 enables U.S. banks and insurance firms to affiliate, facilitates
 affiliations between U.S. banks and securities firms, and
expands the permissible principal investing activities of U.S.
banking organizations. This legislation may further accelerate
consolidation and increase competition in the financial services
industry and will enable banking organizations to compete more
effectively across a broad range of activities.

<P align="center">12

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left"><A HREF="#toc">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly
increased the capital base and geographic reach of our
competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of
the securities and other financial services markets. As a result,
 we have had to commit capital to support our international
operations and to execute large global transactions.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We believe that some of our most significant challenges and
opportunities will arise outside the United States. In order to
take advantage of these opportunities, we will have to compete
successfully with financial institutions based in important
non-U.S. markets, particularly in Europe. Some of these
institutions are larger and better capitalized, and have a
stronger local presence and a longer operating history in these
markets.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have experienced intense price competition in some of our
businesses in recent years. For example, equity and debt
underwriting discounts have been under pressure for a number of
years and the ability to execute trades electronically, through
the Internet and through other alternative trading systems may
increase the pressure on trading commissions. It appears that
this trend toward alternative trading systems will continue and
probably accelerate. Similarly, underwriting spreads in certain
privatizations have been subject to considerable pressure. We
believe that we may experience pricing pressures in these and
other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to
obtain market share by reducing prices.

<P align="left"><B>Regulation</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the securities and commodity
futures and options industries, is subject to extensive
regulation in the United States and elsewhere. As a matter of
public policy, regulatory bodies in the United States and the
rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of
the securities and other financial markets and with protecting
the interests of customers participating in those markets. They
are not, however, charged with protecting the interests of
Goldman Sachs&#146; shareholders or creditors. In the United
States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the
administration of the federal securities laws. Goldman,
Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. is registered as a broker-dealer and as an
investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all
50&nbsp;states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory
organizations, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, the NYSE and
the NASD, adopt rules and examine broker-dealers such as Goldman,
 Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. In addition, state securities and other
regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over
Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. Similarly, our businesses are also
subject to regulation by various non-U.S. governmental and
regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually
all countries where we have offices.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects
of the securities business, including sales methods, trade
practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of
customers&#146; funds and securities, capital structure,
record-keeping, the financing of customers&#146; purchases, and
the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Additional
legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory
organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of
 existing laws and rules, either in the United States or
elsewhere, may directly affect the mode of operation and
profitability of Goldman Sachs.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory
organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the
United States, are empowered to conduct administrative
proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of
cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a
broker-dealer or its directors, officers or employees.
Occasionally, our subsidiaries have been subject to
investigations and proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed
for infractions of various regulations relating to our
activities, none of which has had a material adverse effect on us
 or our businesses.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The commodity futures and options industry in the United States
is subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, as
amended. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the federal
agency charged with the administration of the Commodity Exchange
Act and the

<P align="center">13

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left"><A HREF="#toc">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<DIV align="left">
regulations thereunder. Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. is
registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a
futures commission merchant, commodity pool operator and
commodity trading advisor.
</DIV>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As a registered broker-dealer and member of various
self-regulatory organizations, Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. is
subject to the SEC&#146;s uniform net capital rule,
Rule&nbsp;15c3-1. This rule specifies the minimum level of net
capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that part
 of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Goldman,
Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. is also subject to the net capital
requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
various securities and commodity exchanges. See Note&nbsp;12 to
the consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference
in Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on
Form&nbsp;10-K.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules
that require notification when net capital falls below certain
predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of subordinated debt to
equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer
and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its
business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the
SEC&#146;s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements
that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from
distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to
 the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In January&nbsp;1999, the SEC adopted revisions to its uniform
net capital rule and related regulations that permit the
registration of over-the-counter derivatives dealers as
broker-dealers. An over-the-counter derivatives dealer can, upon
adoption of a risk management framework in accordance with the
new rules, utilize a capital requirement based upon proprietary
models for estimating market risk exposures. We have established
Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. and registered this company
 with the SEC as an over-the-counter derivatives dealer to
conduct in a more capital-efficient manner certain
over-the-counter derivative businesses previously conducted in
other affiliates.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman Sachs is an active participant in the international fixed
 income and equity markets. Many of our affiliates that
participate in those markets are subject to comprehensive
regulations that include some form of capital adequacy rule and
other customer protection rules. Goldman Sachs provides
investment services in and from the United Kingdom under a
regulatory regime that is undergoing comprehensive restructuring
aimed at implementing the Financial Services Authority as the
United Kingdom&#146;s unified financial services regulator. The
relevant Goldman Sachs entities in London are at present
regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority Limited in
respect of their investment banking, individual asset management,
 brokerage and principal trading activities, and the Investment
Management Regulatory Organization in respect of their
institutional asset management and fund management activities.
Some of these Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the
London Stock Exchange and other U.K. securities and commodities
exchanges of which they are members. It is expected, however,
that during 2000, the responsibilities of the Securities and
Futures Authority Limited and Investment Management Regulatory
Organization will be taken over by the Financial Services
Authority. The investment services that are subject to oversight
by U.K. regulators are regulated in accordance with European
Union directives requiring, among other things, compliance with
certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection
requirements and conduct of business rules. These standards,
requirements and rules are similarly implemented, under the same
directives, throughout the European Union and are broadly
comparable in scope and purpose to the regulatory capital and
customer protection requirements imposed under the SEC and
Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules. European Union
directives also permit local regulation in each jurisdiction,
including those in which we operate, to be more restrictive than
the requirements of such directives and these local requirements
can result in certain competitive disadvantages to Goldman Sachs.
 In addition, the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the Financial
Supervisory Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Tokyo
International Financial Futures Exchange and the Japan Securities
 Dealers Association in Japan, the Securities and Futures
Commission in Hong Kong,

<DIV align="left">
the Bundesbank in Germany, as well as French and Swiss banking
authorities, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries
and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable
 to the rules of the SEC.
</DIV>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Compliance with net capital requirements of these and other
regulators could limit those operations of our subsidiaries that
require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and
trading activities and the financing of customer account
balances, and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital
 from our regulated subsidiaries, which in turn could limit our
ability to repay debt or pay dividends on our common stock.

<P align="left"><B>Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As an investment banking and securities firm, our businesses are
materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and
economic conditions generally, both in the United States and
elsewhere around the world. The financial markets in the United
States and elsewhere have achieved record or near record levels,
and the favorable business environment in which we operate will
not continue indefinitely. In the event of a change in market
conditions, our businesses could be adversely affected in many
ways, including the following:

	A market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of

If any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize to
 hedge or otherwise manage our exposure to various types of risk
are not effective, we may incur losses. Our hedging strategies
and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective
in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or
against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified
or unanticipated. Some of our methods of managing risk are based
upon our use of observed historical market behavior. As a result,
 these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could
 be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate.
Other risk management methods depend upon evaluation of
information regarding markets, clients or other matters. This
information may not in all cases be accurate, complete,
up-to-date or properly evaluated.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The financial services industry&nbsp;&#151; and all of our
businesses&nbsp;&#151; are intensely competitive, and we expect
them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of
factors, including

<P align="center">15

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left"><A HREF="#toc">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<DIV align="left">
transaction execution, our products and services, innovation,
reputation and price. We believe that we may experience pricing
pressures in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain
 market share by reducing prices. In recent years, there has been
 substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the
 financial services industry. Recent financial services
legislation, which significantly expands the activities
permissible for firms affiliated with a U.S. bank, may accelerate
 this consolidation and further increase competition. This trend
toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased
the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This
trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and
other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to
commit capital to support our international operations and to
execute large global transactions.
</DIV>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
of highly skilled individuals. Competition in the financial
services industry for qualified employees is intense. Our
continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses
depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and
 motivate our existing employees. The steps we have taken to
encourage the continued service of our employees since our
conversion to corporate form may not be effective.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Liquidity, i.e., ready access to funds, is essential to our
businesses. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to
access the long-term or short-term debt capital markets, an
inability to access the repurchase and securities lending
markets, or an impairment of our ability to sell assets. Our
ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market
participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time.
 In addition, a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely
affect our liquidity and competitive position and increase our
borrowing costs.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money,
securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.
These parties may default on their obligations to us due to
bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other
reasons. The amount and duration of our credit exposures have
been increasing over the past several years. In addition, we have
 also experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend
 credit against less liquid collateral and price more
aggressively the credit risks that we take. Although we regularly
 review our credit exposure to specific clients and
counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions
that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may
arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect
or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one
institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses
or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely
affect Goldman Sachs.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on
 a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous
and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we
process have become increasingly complex. If any of our
financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not
operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss,
 a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory
 intervention or reputational damage. The inability of our
systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could
 also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action
against Goldman Sachs could have a material adverse financial
effect or cause significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs,
which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. We
face significant legal risks in our businesses and the volume and
 amount of damages claimed in litigation against financial
intermediaries are increasing. In addition, we would expect legal
 claims by customers and clients to increase in a market
downturn.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the financial services
industry, is subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions
around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by
 regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct
business. Among other things, we could be fined or prohibited
from engaging in some of our business activities. New laws or

<P align="center">16

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left"><A HREF="#toc">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<DIV align="left">
regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or
regulations applicable to our clients may also adversely affect
our businesses.
</DIV>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving
fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services
industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee
misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter
employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and
detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We believe that some of our most significant challenges and
opportunities will arise outside the United States. In order to
take advantage of these opportunities, we will have to compete
successfully with financial institutions based in important
non-U.S. markets, particularly in Europe. Some of these
institutions are larger and better capitalized, and have a
stronger local presence and a longer operating history in these
markets.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In conducting our businesses in major markets around the world,
we are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and
other risks that are inherent in operating in other countries,
including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price
 controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental
actions. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable
to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain
 and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the
exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability
to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular foreign
market could have a significant and negative effect not only on
our businesses in that market but also on our reputation
generally. We are also subject to the risk that transactions we
structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the last several years, various emerging market countries have
 experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including
 significant devaluations of their currencies and low or negative
 growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of these
conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and
increased volatility in financial markets generally. As we expand
 our businesses in emerging and other markets, our exposure to
these risks will increase.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Securities and futures transactions are now being conducted
through the Internet and other alternative, non-traditional
trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative
 trading systems will continue and probably accelerate. A
dramatic increase in computer-based or other electronic trading
may adversely affect our commission and trading revenues, reduce
our participation in the trading markets and associated access to
 market information and lead to the creation of new and stronger
competitors.

Our principal executive offices are located at 85&nbsp;Broad
Street, New York, New York, and comprise approximately 969,000
square feet of leased space, pursuant to a lease agreement
expiring in June&nbsp;2008 (with an option to renew for up to 20
additional years). We also occupy over 500,000 square feet at
each of 1&nbsp;New York Plaza and 10&nbsp;Hanover Square in New
York, New York, pursuant to lease agreements expiring in
September&nbsp;2004 (with an option to renew for ten years) and
June&nbsp;2018, respectively. Additionally, we have a 15-year
lease for approximately 605,000 square feet at 180&nbsp;Maiden
Lane in New York, New York, that expires in March&nbsp;2014. In
total, we lease over 3.6 million square feet in the New York
area. We have additional offices in the United States and
elsewhere in the Americas. Together, these offices comprise
approximately 680,000 square feet of leased space.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the first quarter of 2000, we executed a contract to purchase
approximately six acres of unimproved land in Jersey City, New
Jersey. We expect to develop this land to complement our offices
in lower Manhattan. The initial phase of development is expected
to include approximately 1.4 million usable square feet of office
 space, with occupancy planned for early 2003.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We also have offices in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. In
Europe, we have offices that totaled approximately 788,000 square
 feet as of the end of January&nbsp;2000. Our largest presence

in Europe is in London, where we leased approximately 609,000
square feet through various leases as of the end of
January&nbsp;2000, with the principal one for Peterborough Court
expiring in 2016. An additional 453,000 square feet of leased
space in London is expected to be occupied during 2000 and 2001.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Asia, we have offices that total approximately 563,000 square
feet. Our largest offices in this region are in Tokyo and Hong
Kong. In Tokyo, we currently lease approximately 234,000 square
feet under renewable leases with current terms extending, in some
 cases, to June&nbsp;2005. In Hong Kong, we currently lease
approximately 222,000 square feet under a lease that expires in
2012. There are significant expansion efforts underway in Tokyo
and Singapore.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our space requirements have increased significantly over the last
 several years. Currently, Goldman Sachs is at or near capacity
at most of its locations. As a result, we have been actively
leasing additional space to support our anticipated growth. Based
 on our progress to date, we believe that we will be able to
acquire additional space to meet our anticipated needs.

We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and

might be material to our operating results for any particular
period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such
period.

<P align="left"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>MobileMedia Securities Litigation</I></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. has been named as a defendant in a
purported class action lawsuit commenced on December&nbsp;6, 1996
 and pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Jersey. This lawsuit was brought on behalf of purchasers of
common stock of MobileMedia Corporation in an underwritten
offering in 1995 and purchasers of senior subordinated notes of
MobileMedia Communications Inc. in a concurrent underwritten
offering. Defendants are MobileMedia Corporation, certain of its
officers and directors, and the lead underwriters, including
Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. MobileMedia Corporation is
currently reorganizing in bankruptcy.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. underwrote 2,242,500 shares of common
stock, for a total price of approximately $53 million, and
Goldman Sachs International underwrote 718,750 shares, for a
total price of approximately $17 million. Goldman,
Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. underwrote approximately $38 million in
principal amount of the senior subordinated notes.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The consolidated class action complaint alleges violations of the
 disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seeks
 compensatory and/or rescissory damages. In light of MobileMedia
Corporation&#146;s bankruptcy, the action against it has been
stayed. Defendants&#146; motion to dismiss was denied in
October&nbsp;1998.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The parties have entered into a stipulation of settlement, which
was approved by the court on February&nbsp;7, 2000, but the time
to appeal has yet to expire.

<P align="left"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Antitrust Matters</I></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. is one of numerous financial services
companies that have been named as defendants in certain purported
 class actions brought in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York by purchasers of securities in
public offerings, who claim that the defendants engaged in
conspiracies in violation of federal antitrust laws in connection
 with these offerings. The plaintiffs in each instance seek
treble damages as well as injunctive relief. One of the actions,
which was commenced on August&nbsp;21, 1998, alleges that the
defendants have conspired to discourage or restrict the resale of
 securities for a period after the offerings,

<P align="center">18

including by imposing &#147;penalty bids&#148;. Defendants moved
to dismiss the complaint in November&nbsp;1998. The plaintiffs
amended their complaint in February&nbsp;1999, modifying their
claims in various ways, including limiting the proposed class to
retail purchasers of public offerings. On May&nbsp;7, 1999, the
defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.
</DIV>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Several other actions were commenced, beginning on
November&nbsp;3, 1998, that allege that the defendants, many of
whom are also named in the other action discussed above, have
conspired to fix at 7% the discount that underwriting syndicates
receive from issuers of shares in certain offerings. On
March&nbsp;15, 1999, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended
complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated
amended complaint on April&nbsp;29, 1999.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. received a Civil Investigative Demand on
 April&nbsp;29, 1999 from the U.S. Department of Justice
requesting information with respect to its investigation of an
alleged conspiracy among securities underwriters to fix
underwriting fees.

Hull Trading Co. L.L.C., an affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group,

which have been named as defendants, together with five national
securities exchanges, in a purported class action brought in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on
behalf of persons who purchased or sold listed equity options.
The consolidated class action complaint, filed on October&nbsp;4,
 1999 (which consolidated certain previously pending actions and
added Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. and other market makers as
defendants), generally alleges that the defendants engaged in a
conspiracy to preclude the multiple listing of certain equity
options on the exchanges and seeks treble damages under the
antitrust laws as well as injunctive relief. On January&nbsp;28,
2000, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated class
action complaint.

<P align="left"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. Litigation
</I></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Several former shareholders of Rockefeller Center Properties,
Inc. brought purported class actions in the U.S. District Court
for the District of Delaware and the Delaware Court of Chancery
arising from the acquisition of Rockefeller Center Properties,
Inc. by an investor group in July&nbsp;1996. The defendants in
the actions include, among others, Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co.,
 Whitehall Real Estate Partnership&nbsp;V, a fund advised by
Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co., a Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co.
managing director and other members of the investor group. The
federal court actions, which have since been consolidated, were
filed beginning on November&nbsp;15, 1996, and the state court
action was filed on May&nbsp;29, 1998.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The complaints generally allege that the proxy statement
disseminated to former Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc.
stockholders in connection with the transaction was deficient, in
 violation of the disclosure requirements of the federal
securities laws. The plaintiffs are seeking, among other things,
unspecified damages, rescission of the acquisition, and/or
disgorgement.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In a series of decisions, the federal district court granted
summary judgment dismissing all the claims in the federal action.
 The plaintiffs appealed those rulings.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On July&nbsp;19, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit rendered its decision affirming in part and vacating in
part the lower court&#146;s entry of summary judgment dismissing
the action. With respect to the claim as to which summary
judgment was vacated, the appellate court held that the district
court had committed a procedural error in converting the
defendants&#146; motion to dismiss into a motion for summary
judgment and remanded for the district court to reconsider that
claim under appropriate standards applicable to motions to
dismiss. Plaintiffs have since sought leave to amend the
complaint as to the remanded claim. The defendants have moved to
dismiss the remanded claim and are opposing the plaintiffs&#146;
motion to amend it further.

against Goldman Sachs International in relation to the
plaintiffs&#146; 1997 purchase of the polymer division of one of
Goldman Sachs International&#146;s Norwegian clients, Jotun A/S.
The plaintiffs claim that they overpaid by $40 million based upon
 misrepresentations concerning the financial performance of the
polymer division.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In November&nbsp;1998, the Commercial Court granted Goldman Sachs
 International&#146;s application for a stay of the action
pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings between Reichhold

<P align="left"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Matters Relating to Municipal Securities</I>
</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co., together with a number of other firms
active in the municipal securities area, has received requests
beginning in June&nbsp;1995 for information from the SEC and
certain other federal and state agencies and authorities with
respect to the pricing of escrow securities sold by Goldman,
Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. to certain municipal bond issuers in
connection with the advanced refunding of municipal securities.
Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. understands that certain municipal
bond issuers to which Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. sold escrow
securities have also received such inquiries.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There have been published reports that an action under the
Federal False Claims Act was filed in February&nbsp;1995 alleging
 unlawful and undisclosed overcharges in certain advance
refunding transactions by a private plaintiff on behalf of the
United States and that Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co., together
with a number of other firms, is a named defendant in that
action. The complaint was reportedly filed under seal while the
government determines whether it will pursue the claims directly.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. is also one of many municipal
underwriting firms that have been named as defendants in a
purported class action brought on November&nbsp;24, 1998 in the
U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by the
Clerk of Collier County, Florida on behalf of municipal issuers
which purchased escrow securities since October&nbsp;1986 in
connection with advance refundings. The amended complaint alleges
 that the securities were excessively &#147;marked up&#148; in
violation of the Investment Advisers Act and Florida law, and
that the defendants violated the federal antitrust laws in
connection with the prices at which escrow securities were sold
to municipal issuers. The complaint seeks to recover the
difference between the actual and alleged &#147;fair&#148; prices
 of the escrow securities and to treble the alleged damages with
respect to the antitrust claim. On October&nbsp;29, 1999, the
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.

beginning on April&nbsp;27, 1999 in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York. The lawsuits, which have been
consolidated, were brought on behalf of purchasers of stock of
AMF Bowling, Inc. in an underwritten initial public offering of
15,525,000 shares of common stock in November&nbsp;1997 at a
price of $19.50 per share. Defendants are AMF Bowling, Inc.,
certain officers and directors of AMF Bowling, Inc. (including
the Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. managing director), and the
lead underwriters of the offering (including Goldman,
Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co.). The consolidated amended complaint alleges
 violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal
securities laws and seeks compensatory damages and/or rescission.
 The complaint asserts that The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and the
 Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. managing director are liable as
controlling persons under the federal securities laws because
certain funds managed by Goldman Sachs owned a majority of the
outstanding common stock of AMF Bowling, Inc. and the

Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. has been named as a defendant in two
purported class action lawsuits commenced, beginning on
May&nbsp;26, 1999, in the U.S. District Court for the District of
 Columbia. These lawsuits were brought on behalf of purchasers of
 Class&nbsp;A common stock of Iridium World Communications, Ltd.
in a January&nbsp;1999 underwritten secondary offering of
7,500,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock at a price of
$33.40 per share, as well as in the secondary market. The
defendants in the actions include Iridium, certain of its
officers and directors, Motorola, Inc. (an investor in Iridium)
and the lead underwriters in the offering, including Goldman,
Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The complaints in both actions allege violations of the
disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seek
compensatory and/or rescissory damages. Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38;
 Co. underwrote 996,500 shares of common stock and Goldman Sachs
International underwrote 320,625 shares of common stock for a
total offering price of approximately $44 million.

Court for the District of Columbia under the <I>qui tam </I>
provisions of the federal False Claims Act in connection with
certain auctions of competitive loans on behalf of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Goldman,

complaint alleges, among other things, that (i)&nbsp;Goldman,
Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. and its bidding partners improperly directed
 approximately $4.7 billion of government-owned notes for prices
below that which would have been obtained in full and fair
competition, (ii)&nbsp;the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development&#146;s financial advisor in connection with such
auctions provided Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&#38; Co. and its bidding

Information relating to the principal market in which our common

trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May&nbsp;4, 1999 is set
 forth under the caption &#147;Stock Price Range&#148; on
page&nbsp;74 of the 1999 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is
incorporated by reference in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on
 Form&nbsp;10-K. As of January&nbsp;17, 2000, there were
approximately 591 holders of record of our common stock. There is
 no established public trading market for our nonvoting common
stock.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During fiscal 1999, dividends of $0.12 per share of common stock
and nonvoting common stock were declared on June&nbsp;23, 1999
and September&nbsp;20, 1999. The holders of our common stock and
nonvoting common stock share proportionately on a per share basis
 in all dividends and other distributions declared by our board
of directors.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The declaration of dividends by Goldman Sachs is subject to the
discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors will
 take into account such matters as general business conditions,
our financial results, capital requirements, contractual, legal
and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us to
our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, the effect on our
debt ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may
 deem relevant. See &#147;Business&nbsp;&#151; Regulation&#148;
in Item&nbsp;1 of this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for a
discussion of potential regulatory limitations on our receipt of
funds from our regulated subsidiaries.

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to
in our report dated January&nbsp;21, 2000 appearing in the 1999
Annual Report to Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
and Subsidiaries (which report and consolidated financial
statements are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on
 Form 10-K) also included an audit of the financial statement
schedule listed in Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K. In our
opinion, this financial statement schedule presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements.

                                   ARTICLE II
                        LIMITATIONS ON TRANSFER OF SHARES

                  Section 2.1 General. Each Covered Person agrees that such
Covered Person shall not Transfer any Covered Shares beneficially owned by such
Covered Person, except in accordance with all of the following: (a) the terms of
this Agreement, (b) the restrictions on transferability of Common Stock
contained in the Plan of Incorporation (the "PLP Transfer Restrictions"), if
applicable, and (c) the terms of any other contract or agreement with the
Company or other undertaking by which such Covered Person is bound and to which
such Covered Shares are subject.

                  Section 2.2 General Transfer Restrictions. Each Covered Person
agrees that for so long as such Covered Person is an Employee Covered Person
such Covered Person shall at all times be the Sole Beneficial Owner of at least
that number of Covered Shares which equals 25% of the aggregate number of
Covered Shares (a) beneficially owned by such Covered Person at the time such
Covered Person became a Covered Person and (b) beneficial ownership of which is
acquired by such Covered Person thereafter, with no reduction in such aggregate
number for Covered Shares disposed of by such Covered Person (the "General
Transfer Restrictions"). For purposes of this Section 2.2 only, Covered Shares
held by the trust underlying The Goldman Sachs Defined Contribution Plan and
allocated to a Covered Person shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by
such Covered Person until such Covered Shares are distributed to such Covered
Person in accordance with the terms of The Goldman Sachs Defined Contribution
Plan. For purposes of this Section 2.2 only, when a delivery of Covered Shares
is made by GS Inc. or by the trustee of the trust underlying The Goldman Sachs


                                       -5-
<PAGE>   6
Defined Contribution Plan to a Covered Person net of Covered Shares to be
withheld for tax purposes or to be paid for the receipt of such delivered
Covered Shares, the recipient of such delivered number of Covered Shares shall
be treated as if such Covered Person acquired the total (gross) number of
Covered Shares to be delivered before giving effect to any such withholding or
payment.

                  Section 2.3    Compliance with Certain Restrictions.

                  (a) Each Covered Person agrees that, with respect to all
         Common Stock beneficially owned by such Covered Person, such Covered
         Person shall comply with the restrictions on transfer imposed by
         Section 6(e) of the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of May 3, 1999,
         among GS Inc. and the several underwriters named therein, whether or
         not said Section refers to such Covered Person by name.

                  (b) Each Employee Covered Person agrees that, with respect to
         all Common Stock beneficially owned by such Employee Covered Person,
         and each Covered Person who is not an Employee Covered Person agrees
         that, with respect to all Covered Shares beneficially owned by such
         Covered Person which could not then be Transferred without contravening
         the PLP Transfer Restrictions, at the request of GS Inc. such Covered
         Person shall comply with any future restrictions on transfer imposed by
         or with the consent of GS Inc. from time to time in connection with any
         future offerings of securities of GS Inc., whether by GS Inc. or by any
         securityholder of GS Inc. and whether or not such restrictions on
         transfer refer to such Covered Person by name.

                  (c) Each Employee Covered Person agrees that, with respect to
         all Common Stock beneficially owned by such Employee Covered Person,
         such Employee Covered Person will comply with any restrictions imposed
         by the Company from time to time to enable the Company or any party to
         an agreement with the Company to account for a business combination by
         the pooling of interests method.

                  Section 2.4 Holding of Covered Shares in Custody and in
Nominee Name; Legend on Certificates; Entry of Stop Transfer Orders.

                  (a) Each Covered Person understands and agrees that all
         Covered Shares beneficially owned by each Employee Covered Person and
         all Covered Shares which could not then be Transferred without
         contravening the PLP Transfer Restrictions beneficially owned by each
         Covered Person who is not an Employee Covered Person (in each case
         other than Covered Shares held of record by a trustee in a compensation
         or benefit plan administered by the Company and other


                                       -6-

         Covered Shares that have been pledged to the Company to secure the
         performance of such Covered Person's obligations under any agreement
         with the Company) shall be registered in the name of a nominee for such
         Covered Person and shall be held in the custody of a custodian until
         otherwise determined by the Shareholders' Committee or the Board of
         Directors of GS Inc. or until such time as such Covered Shares are
         released pursuant to Section 2.4(e) or Section 2.4(f) hereof (whichever
         occurs first), and each Covered Person agrees to assign, endorse and
         register for transfer into such nominee name or deliver to such
         custodian any such Covered Shares which are not so registered or so
         held, as the case may be. The form of the custody agreement and the
         identity of the custodian and nominee must be satisfactory in form and
         substance to the Shareholders' Committee and GS Inc.

                  (b) Whenever the nominee holder shall receive any dividend or
         other distribution upon any Covered Shares other than in Covered
         Shares, the Shareholders' Committee will give or cause to be given
         notice or direction to the applicable nominee and/or custodian referred
         to in paragraph (a) to permit the prompt distribution of such dividend
         or distribution to the beneficial owner of such Covered Shares, net of
         any tax withholding amounts required to be withheld by the nominee,
         unless the distribution of such dividend or distribution is restricted
         by the terms of another agreement between the Covered Person and the
         Company known to the Shareholders' Committee.

                  (c) Each Covered Person understands and agrees that any
         outstanding certificate representing Covered Shares beneficially owned
         by an Employee Covered Person or representing Covered Shares which
         could not then be Transferred without contravening the PLP Transfer
         Restrictions beneficially owned by a Covered Person who is not an
         Employee Covered Person, and any agreement or other instrument
         evidencing restricted stock units, options or other rights to receive
         or acquire Covered Shares beneficially owned by such Covered Person,
         may bear a legend noted conspicuously on each such certificate,
         agreement or other instrument reading substantially as follows:

                  "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO
                  THE PROVISIONS OF EITHER OR BOTH OF A SHAREHOLDERS' AGREEMENT

                  (d) Each Covered Person agrees and consents to the entry of
         stop transfer orders against the transfer of Covered Shares subject to
         Transfer Restrictions except in compliance with this Agreement.

                  (e) The Shareholders' Committee shall develop procedures for
         releasing all Covered Shares of each Covered Person who is not an
         Employee Covered Person which could then be Transferred without
         contravening any Transfer Restrictions to or at the direction of such
         Covered Person free and clear of all restrictions and legends described
         in this Section 2.4.

                  (f) The Shareholders' Committee shall also develop procedures
         for releasing (free and clear of all restrictions and legends described
         in this Section 2.4) a specified number of Covered Shares of an
         Employee Covered Person upon the request of any Covered Person and to
         or at the direction of such Employee Covered Person, provided that such
         request is accompanied by a certificate of such requesting Covered
         Person (i) indicating such requesting Covered Person's intention to
         Transfer promptly such specified number of Covered Shares and (ii)
         establishing that such specified number of Covered Shares are then
         permitted to be Transferred without contravening any Transfer
         Restrictions (which evidence must be satisfactory to the Shareholders'
         Committee).

                  Each Covered Person severally agrees for himself that the
foregoing provision of this Article III shall be a continuing representation and
covenant of such Covered Person during the period that such person shall be a
Covered Person and shares of Common Stock of such person shall be Covered
Shares, and such Covered Person shall take all actions as shall from time to

                                VOTING AGREEMENT

                  Section 4.1 Preliminary Vote of Covered Persons. Prior to any
vote of the stockholders of GS Inc. there shall be a separate, preliminary vote,
on each matter upon which a stockholder vote is proposed to be taken (each, a
"Preliminary Vote"), of the Covered Shares beneficially owned by (a) through
December 31, 2000, all Covered Persons, and (b) on and after January 1, 2001,
the Employee Covered Persons (including in both clause (a) and (b) and for the

                  (a) By his signature hereto, each Covered Person hereby gives
         the Shareholders' Committee, with full power of substitution and
         resubstitution, an irrevocable proxy to vote or otherwise act with
         respect to all of the Covered Person's Voted Covered Shares, as fully,
         to the same extent and with the same effect as such Covered Person
         might or could do under any applicable laws or regulations governing
         the rights and powers of stockholders of a Delaware corporation and (i)
         directs that such proxy shall be voted in connection with such matters
         as are the subject of a Preliminary Vote as provided in this Agreement
         --in accordance with such Preliminary Vote, (ii) authorizes the holder
         of such proxy to vote on such other matters as may come before a
         meeting of stockholders of GS Inc. or any adjournment thereof and as
         are related, directly or indirectly, to the matter which was the
         subject of the Preliminary Vote -- as the aforementioned persons see
         fit in their discretion but in a manner consistent with the Preliminary
         Vote, and (iii) authorizes the holder of such proxy to vote on such
         other matters as may come before a meeting of stockholders of GS Inc.
         or any adjournment thereof (including matters related to adjournment
         thereof) -- as the aforementioned persons see fit in their discretion
         but not to cast any vote under this clause (iii) which is inconsistent
         with the Preliminary Vote or which would achieve an outcome that would
         frustrate the intent of the Preliminary Vote. Each such Covered Person
         hereby affirms that this proxy is given as a term of this Agreement and
         as such is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. It is further
         understood and agreed by each such Covered Person that this proxy may
         be exercised by the aforementioned persons with respect to all Voted
         Covered Shares of such Covered Person for the period beginning on the
         date hereof and ending on the date this Agreement shall have been
         terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(a) hereof.

                  (b) By his signature hereto, each Covered Person appoints the
         Shareholders' Committee, with full power of substitution and
         resubstitution, his true and lawful attorney-in-fact to direct, in
         accordance with the provisions of this Article IV, the voting of any
         Voted Covered Shares held of record by any other person but
         beneficially owned by such Covered Person (including Voted Covered
         Shares held by the trust underlying The Goldman Sachs Defined
         Contribution Plan and allocated to such Covered Person), granting to
         such attorneys, and each of them, full power and authority to do and
         perform each and every act and thing whatsoever that such attorney or
         attorneys may deem necessary, advisable or appropriate to carry out
         fully the intent of Section 4.2 and Section 4.3(a) as such Covered
         Person might or could do personally, hereby ratifying and confirming
         all acts and things that such attorney or attorneys may do or cause to
         be done by virtue of this power of attorney. It is understood and
         agreed by each such Covered Person that this appointment, empowerment
         and authorization may be exercised by the aforementioned persons with
         respect to all Voted Covered Shares of such Covered Person, and held of
         record by another person, for the period beginning on

Persons and members of the Board of Directors of GS Inc. and who agree to serve

         Agreement (including determinations of beneficial ownership) shall be

         final and binding. The Shareholders' Committee's determinations under
         this Agreement and the Plan of Incorporation and actions (including
         waivers) hereunder and thereunder need not be uniform and may be made

         of the Shareholders' Committee in acting hereunder shall at all times

         officers of the Company and in so acting or failing to act shall not
         have any fiduciary duties to the Covered Persons as a member of the
         Shareholders' Committee by virtue of the fact that one or more of such
         members may also be serving as a director or officer of the Company or
         otherwise.

                  (c) The Shareholders' Committee shall act through a majority
         vote of its members and such actions may be taken in person at a
         meeting or by a written instrument signed by all of the members.

                  (b) By his signature hereto, each Covered Person appoints the

         carry out fully the intent of this Section 6.3 as such Covered Person
         might or could do personally, hereby ratifying and confirming all acts
         and things that such attorney or attorneys may do or cause to be done
         by virtue of this power of attorney. Each Covered Person hereby further
         designates such attorneys as such Covered Person's


                                      -14-
<PAGE>   15
         agents authorized to receive notices and communications with respect to
         such reports and any amendments thereto. It is understood and agreed by
         each such Covered Person that this appointment, empowerment and
         authorization may be exercised by the aforementioned persons for the
         period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the date such Covered
         Person is no longer subject to the provisions of this Agreement (and
         shall extend thereafter for such time as is required to reflect that
         such Covered Person is no longer a party to this Agreement).

                  Section 6.4 Adjustment upon Changes in Capitalization;
Adjustments upon Changes of Control; Representatives, Successors and Assigns.

                  (a) In the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock
         by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits,
         spin-offs, split-ups, recapitalizations, combinations, exchanges of
         shares and the like, the term "Covered Shares" shall refer to and
         include the securities received or resulting therefrom, but only to the
         extent such securities are received in exchange for or in respect of
         Covered Shares. Upon the occurrence of any event described in the
         immediately preceding sentence, the Shareholders' Committee shall make
         such adjustments to or interpretations of the restrictions of Section
         2.2 (and, if it so determines, any other provisions hereof) as it shall
         deem necessary or desirable to carry out the intent of such
         provision(s). If the Shareholders' Committee deems it desirable, any
         such adjustments may take effect from the record date, the "when issued
         trading date", the "ex dividend date" or another appropriate date.

                  (b) In the event of any business combination, restructuring,
         recapitalization or other extraordinary transaction involving GS Inc.,
         its Subsidiaries or any of their respective securities or assets as a
         result of which the Covered Persons shall hold voting securities of a
         person other than GS Inc., the Covered Persons agree that this
         Agreement shall also continue in full force and effect with respect to
         such voting securities of such other person formerly representing or
         distributed in respect of Covered Shares of GS Inc., and the terms
         "Covered Shares," "Common Stock" and "Voting Interests," and "GS Inc."
         and "Company," shall refer to such voting securities formerly
         representing or distributed in respect of Covered Shares of GS Inc. and
         such person, respectively. Upon the occurrence of any event described
         in the immediately preceding sentence, the Shareholders' Committee
         shall make such adjustments to or interpretations of the restrictions
         of Section 2.2 (and, if it so determines, any other provisions hereof)
         as it shall deem necessary or desirable to carry out the intent of such
         provision(s). If the Shareholders' Committee deems it desirable, any
         such adjustments may take effect from the record date or another
         appropriate date.

         and assigns of the Covered Persons (and GS Inc. in the event of a
         transaction described in Section 6.4(b) hereof); provided, however,
         that a Covered Person may not assign this Agreement or any of his
         rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of GS
         Inc., and any assignment without such consent by a Covered Person shall
         be void; and provided further that no assignment of this Agreement by
         GS Inc. or to a successor of GS Inc. (by operation of law or otherwise)
         shall be valid unless such assignment is made to a person which
         succeeds to the business of GS Inc.
         substantially as an entirety.

                  Section 6.5 Further Assurances. Each Covered Person agrees to

reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of this Agreement.

         terminated by the affirmative vote of not less than 66 2/3% of the
         outstanding Voting Interests. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
         the expiration or termination of the restrictions on transfer referred

         apply in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(e) of the

         employee for any reason other than death shall no longer be bound by
         the provisions of Section 2.2 and Section 6.1 hereof (unless such
         Covered Person is subject to the PLP Transfer Restrictions in which
         case Section 6.1 shall continue to apply until December 31, 2000) but
         shall be bound by all other provisions of this Agreement until such
         time as such Covered Person holds all Covered Shares free from PLP
         Transfer Restrictions. Thereafter, such Covered Person shall no longer
         be bound by the provisions of this Agreement (other than Sections 5.3,
         6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6,

         to be an employee by reason of death or any Covered Person who ceases
         to be an employee for any reason other than death and who subsequently
         dies shall from and after the date of such death be bound only by the
         restrictions on transfer imposed by Section 2.3(a) hereof and the
         Continuing Provisions; and upon the expiration of the restrictions in
         Section 2.3(a), the estate of such Covered Person shall no longer be
         bound by the provisions of this Agreement (other than the Continuing
         Provisions), and such Covered Person's name shall be removed from
         Appendix A to this Agreement.

                  Section 7.2 Amendments.

                  (a) Except as provided in this Section 7.2, provisions of this

         the outstanding Voting Interests.

                  (b) This Section 7.2(b), Section 7.1(a) and Section 7.3(a)(i)
         may be amended only by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the
         outstanding Voting Interests. Any amendment of any other provision of
         this Agreement that would have the effect, in connection with a tender
         or exchange offer by any person other than the Company as to which the
         Board of Directors of GS Inc. is recommending rejection, of permitting
         Transfers which would not be permitted by the terms of this Agreement
         as theretofore in effect shall also require the affirmative vote of
         66 2/3% of the outstanding Voting Interests.

                  (c) This Section 7.2(c), Article V, Section 7.3(b) and any
         other provision the amendment (or addition) of which has the effect of
         materially changing the rights or obligations of the Shareholders'
         Committee hereunder may be amended (or added) either (i) with the
         approval of the Shareholders' Committee and the affirmative vote of a
         majority of the Voting Interests or (ii) by the affirmative vote of
         66 2/3% of the outstanding Voting Interests.

                  (d) In addition to any other vote or approval that may be

         Restrictions that would make such General Transfer Restrictions
         materially more onerous to a Covered Person will not be enforceable
         against that Covered Person unless that Covered Person has consented to
         such amendment.

                  (e) In addition to any other vote or approval that may be
         required under this Section 7.2, any amendment of this Agreement that
         has the effect of changing the obligations of GS Inc. hereunder to make
         such obligations materially more onerous to GS Inc. shall require the
         approval of GS Inc.

                  (f) In addition to any other vote or approval that may be
         required under this Section 7.2, any amendment that has the effect of
         amending the provisions of Section 2.3(a), 2.3(b) or 2.3(c) shall
         require the approval of GS Inc.

                  (g) Each Covered Person understands that it is intended that
         each managing director of the Company will be a Covered Person under
         this Agreement or will become a Covered Person upon his appointment to
         such position, and each Covered Person further understands that from
         time to time certain other persons may become Covered Persons and
         certain Covered Persons will cease to be bound by the provisions of
         this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof. Accordingly, this
         Agreement may be amended by action of the Shareholders' Committee from
         time to time and without the approval of any other person, but solely
         for the purposes of (i) adding to Appendix A such persons as shall be
         made party to this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof or shall (A)
         be appointed managing directors of the Company and (B) execute a
         counterpart of the signature page of this Agreement, such addition to
         be effective as of the time of such action or appointment and (ii)
         removing from Appendix A such persons as shall cease to be bound by the
         provisions of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1(b) or (c) hereof,

         appropriate changes to Appendix A.

                                 the Board of Directors of GS Inc. is
                                 recommending rejection at the time of such

                                 2.3(a), 2.3(b) and 2.3(c) shall also require
                                 the prior written consent of GS Inc.);

                        (ii)     The Shareholders' Committee may waive the PLP
                                 Transfer Restrictions in all circumstances
                                 other than in connection with a tender or
                                 exchange offer by any person other than the
                                 Company; and

                        (iii)    The Shareholders' Committee may waive any or
                                 all of the Transfer Restrictions and the other
                                 provisions of this Agreement with respect to
                                 Covered Shares owned by a person at the time
                                 the person becomes a managing director of the
                                 Company or acquired by the person in connection
                                 with such person's becoming a managing director
                                 of the Company; provided that such person was
                                 not an employee of the Company prior to the
                                 granting of such waiver by the Shareholders'
                                 Committee.

                  (c) GS Inc. agrees that the PLP Transfer Restrictions shall be
         deemed to be waived under the Plan of Incorporation if they are waived
         as provided in this Agreement.

                  (d) In connection with any waiver granted under this
         Agreement, the Shareholders' Committee or the holders of the percentage

         impose such conditions as they determine on the granting of such
         waivers.

                  (e) The failure of the Company or the Shareholders' Committee
         at any time or times to require performance of any provision of this
         Agreement shall in no manner affect the rights at a later time to
         enforce the same. No waiver by the Company or the Shareholders'
         Committee of the breach of any term contained in this Agreement,
         whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be
         deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such
         breach or the breach of any other term of this Agreement.

                  Section 7.4 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY

                  (a) The Shareholders' Committee shall have the sole and
         exclusive power to enforce the provisions of this Agreement. The
         Shareholders' Committee may in its sole discretion request GS Inc. to
         conduct such enforcement, and GS Inc. agrees to conduct such
         enforcement as requested and directed by the Shareholders' Committee.

                  (b) Without diminishing the finality and conclusive effect of
         any determination by the Shareholders' Committee of any matter under
         this Agreement which is provided herein to be determined or proposed by
         the Shareholders' Committee (and subject to the provisions of
         paragraphs (c) and (d) hereof), any dispute, controversy or claim
         arising out of or relating to or concerning the provisions of this
         Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in New York City
         before, and in accordance with the rules then obtaining of, the New
         York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"), or if the NYSE declines to
         arbitrate the matter, the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in
         accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b), and in
         addition to its right to submit any dispute or controversy to
         arbitration, the Shareholders' Committee may bring, or may cause GS
         Inc. to bring, on behalf of the Shareholders' Committee or on behalf of
         one or more Covered Persons, an action or special proceeding in a state
         or federal court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the State of
         Delaware, whether or not an arbitration proceeding has theretofore been
         or is ever initiated, for the purpose of temporarily, preliminarily or
         permanently enforcing the provisions of this Agreement and, for the
         purposes of this paragraph (c), each Covered Person (i) expressly
         consents to the application of paragraph (d) to any such action or
         proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary
         damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be
         difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate and
         (iii) irrevocably appoints each General Counsel of GS Inc., c/o The
         Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange
         Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801 as such Covered Person's agent for
         service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding,
         who shall promptly advise such Covered Person of any such service of
         process.

                  (d) (i) EACH COVERED PERSON HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE
         EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN THE
         STATE OF DELAWARE OVER ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
         RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE
         ARBITRATED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B)

         HEREOF. This includes any suit, action or proceeding to compel
         arbitration or to enforce an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge
         that the forum designated by this paragraph (d) has a reasonable
         relation to this Agreement, and to the parties' relationship with one
         another. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude
         the Shareholders' Committee or GS Inc. from bringing any action or
         proceeding in any other court for the purpose of enforcing the
         provisions of this Section 7.5.

                  (ii) The agreement of the parties as to forum is independent
         of the law that may be applied in the action, and they each agree to
         such forum even if the forum may under applicable law choose to apply
         non-forum law. The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent
         permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter
         may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such
         suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in
         paragraph (d)(i). The parties undertake not to commence any action
         arising out of or relating to or concerning this Agreement in any forum
         other than a forum described in paragraph (d)(i). The parties agree
         that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a final and
         non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding in any
         such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties.

                  Section 7.6 Relationship of Parties. The terms of this
Agreement are intended not to create a separate entity for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, and nothing in this Agreement shall be read to create any
partnership, joint venture or separate entity among the parties or to create any
trust or other fiduciary relationship between them.

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.28


                            INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

         THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of the 7th day of May, 1999, by and between The Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("GS Inc.") and each of the Indemnitees listed on
the signature pages to this agreement (each, an "Indemnitee", and collectively,
the "Indemnitees") as such signature pages may be amended and supplemented from
time to time.

                                   WITNESSETH

         WHEREAS, GS Inc. has become party to a plan for the incorporation of
the business of The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. ("GS Group") and the related
reorganization of the business of GS Group, which plan was approved by The
Goldman Sachs Corporation ("GS Corp.") in its capacity as general partner of GS
Group and by the Schedule II Limited Partners of GS Group in March 1999 (such
plan of incorporation together with all exhibits thereto as it or they may be
amended from time to time, the "Plan of Incorporation");

         WHEREAS, as part of the Plan of Incorporation, GS Inc. has filed and
proposes to file registration statements (the "Registration Statements") with
the Securities and Exchange Commission for the public offering and sale of
shares of its common stock (including shares issuable in connection with
employee benefit plans) and debt securities (including medium-term notes);


<PAGE>   2
         WHEREAS, GS Inc. has requested and will request certain of the
Indemnitees to execute the Registration Statements in the capacity or capacities
listed and to be listed in such Registration Statements; and

         WHEREAS, each Indemnitee is or was one or more of the following: (i) an
officer or director of GS Inc., (ii) an officer or director of GS Corp., (iii) a
person requested or authorized by the board of directors or a person authorized
by the board of directors of GS Inc. or GS Corp. to take actions on behalf of GS
Group, GS Inc. or GS Corp. in connection with the Registration Statements or the
Plan of Incorporation or (iv) a member of the Management Committee or
Partnership Committee of GS Inc. or the former Executive Committee of GS Group.

         NOW, therefore, in consideration of each Indemnitee's acting and
agreeing to act in the capacities referred to above, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties do hereby agree as follows:

         1. General. GS Inc. (A) will indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnitee against any Losses (as hereinafter defined), joint or several, to
which such Indemnitee may become subject, under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act") or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statements or any
related Rule 462(b) Registration Statements or any preliminary prospectus or
prospectus comprising a part thereof, or any


                                       -2-
<PAGE>   3
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided,
however, that GS Inc. shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such Losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission relating to such Indemnitee
made in any preliminary prospectus, any registration statement or any prospectus
or any amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information relating to such Indemnitee furnished to GS Inc. by such Indemnitee
expressly for use therein; and (B) will indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnitee against any Losses (or actions in respect thereof) which otherwise
arise out of or are based upon or asserted against such Indemnitee in connection
with such Indemnitee's acting in the capacities referred to above in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Incorporation, except to the
extent any such Losses referred to in this clause (B) arise out of or are based
upon the type of conduct for which (x) a director would not be exempt from
liability or (y) the indemnification of a director would be limited in respect
of such Losses, in the case of (x) and (y), within the meaning of Article
Twelfth of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of GS Inc. or
Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (whether or not such
Indemnitee is a director).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1, GS Inc. and
each Indemnitee agree that insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising
under the Act


                                       -3-
<PAGE>   4
may be permitted under this Agreement to an Indemnitee who is a director,
officer or controlling person of GS Inc., in the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities is made by such an Indemnitee (other
than the payment by GS Inc. of expenses incurred or paid by such Indemnitee in
the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) in connection with a
Registration Statement, GS Inc. will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
against public policy as expressed in the Act, and GS Inc. and such Indemnitee
will be governed by the final adjudication of such question.

         2. Losses. As used in this Agreement, the term "Losses" shall include,
without limitation, damages, losses, claims, judgments, liabilities, fines,
penalties, excise taxes, settlements, and costs, attorneys' fees, accountants'
fees, and disbursements and costs of attachment or similar bonds, investigation
costs, defense preparation costs, costs of preparing for and presenting evidence
or testimony, and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under
this Agreement. The term "Losses" shall not include taxes except to the extent
taxes are imposed in respect of payments otherwise made pursuant to this
Agreement, in which case such Indemnitee's Losses shall include an amount not
greater than the net taxes payable (taking into account any deductions or other
tax benefits available to such Indemnitee as a result of the Losses in respect
of which such payment is made).


                                       -4-
<PAGE>   5
         3. Enforcement. Subject to the provisions of the second paragraph of
Section 1 hereof, if a claim or request by an Indemnitee under this Agreement is
not paid by GS Inc. or on its behalf, within thirty (30) days after a written
claim or request has been received by GS Inc. and, if applicable, the
affirmation in Section 5 hereof has been received by GS Inc., such Indemnitee
may at any time thereafter commence an arbitration proceeding in accordance with
Section 9 hereof against GS Inc. to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or
request and, if successful in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be
entitled to be paid also the expenses of prosecuting such proceeding. It shall
be a defense to any such proceeding (other than a proceeding commenced to
enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any actual or threatened
proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required affirmation
and undertaking, if any is required, have been tendered to GS Inc.) that such
Indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct for GS Inc. to indemnify such
Indemnitee herein for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense
shall be on GS Inc. Neither the failure of GS Inc. (including its Board of
Directors, legal counsel or shareholders) to have made a determination prior to
the commencement of such proceeding that indemnification of such Indemnitee is
proper in the circumstances because such Indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth herein, nor an actual determination by GS Inc.
(including its Board of Directors, legal counsel or shareholders) that such
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense
to the proceeding or create a presumption that such Indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.


                                       -5-
<PAGE>   6
         4. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any
provision of this Agreement to indemnification by GS Inc. for some or a portion
of any Losses, but not for the total amount thereof, GS Inc. shall nevertheless
indemnify such Indemnitee for the portion of such Losses to which such
Indemnitee is entitled.

         5. Expenses. Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with any
proceeding shall be paid by GS Inc. upon request of such Indemnitee that GS Inc.
pay such expenses, but only upon receipt by GS Inc. of (i) a written affirmation
of such Indemnitee's good faith belief that the applicable standard of conduct
necessary for indemnification by GS Inc. has been met, (ii) a written
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to reimburse GS Inc. for expenses
if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined that the applicable
standard of conduct has not been met and (iii) satisfactory evidence of the
amount of such expenses.

         6. Notice of Claim. Each Indemnitee shall promptly notify GS Inc. in
writing of any claim against such Indemnitee for which indemnification will or
could be sought under this Agreement. In addition, each Indemnitee shall give GS
Inc. such information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall
be within such Indemnitee's power and at such times and places as are not unduly
burdensome for such Indemnitee.

         7. Defense of Claim. With respect to any proceeding as to which an
Indemnitee notifies GS Inc. of the commencement thereof:

                  (a) GS Inc. will be entitled to participate at its own
         expense;


                                       -6-
<PAGE>   7
                  (b) subject to Section 7(c) hereof, GS Inc. shall not, in
         connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
         jurisdiction against any Indemnitee and any other Indemnitees, be
         liable to such Indemnitee and such other Indemnitees for the fees and
         expenses of more than one separate law firm (in addition to a single
         firm of local counsel);

                  (c) except as otherwise provided below, to the extent that it
         may wish, GS Inc. will be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with
         counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee, which in GS Inc.'s
         sole discretion may be regular counsel to GS Inc. and may be counsel to
         other Indemnitees. The Indemnitees also shall have the right to employ
         one separate counsel for such Indemnitees in such action, suit or
         proceeding if such Indemnitees reasonably conclude that if they did not
         there would be a conflict of interest between GS Inc. and such
         Indemnitees, and under such circumstances the fees and expenses of such
         counsel shall be paid by GS Inc.; and

                  (d) GS Inc. shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnitee
         under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action
         or claim effected without GS Inc.'s written consent. GS Inc. shall not
         settle any action or claim in any manner which would impose any cost or
         limitation on an Indemnitee without such Indemnitee's written consent.


                                                  -7-
<PAGE>   8
         Neither GS Inc. nor an Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay
         its consent to any proposed settlement.

         8. Non-exclusivity. The right to indemnification and the payment of
expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition
conferred in this Agreement shall not be exclusive of or affected in any way by
any other right which an Indemnitee may have or hereafter may acquire under any
statute, certificate of incorporation, by-laws, agreement, arrangement,
resolution or instrument providing indemnification or expense payment, except
that any payments otherwise required to be made by GS Inc. hereunder shall be
offset by any and all amounts received by an Indemnitee from any other
indemnitor or under one or more liability insurance policies maintained by an
indemnitor or otherwise and shall not be duplicative of any other payments
received by an Indemnitee from GS Inc. in respect of the matter giving rise to
the indemnity hereunder. When an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification,
expense advancement or reimbursement under this Instrument and any other
agreement, arrangement, resolution or instrument of GS Inc. or The Goldman Sachs
Group, L.P., the Indemnitee may choose to pursue its rights under one or more,
but less than all, of such applicable agreements, arrangements, resolutions or
instruments, in which case such Indemnitee need only comply with the standards
and procedures of the agreements, arrangements, resolutions or instruments under
which it chooses to pursue its rights. Without limiting the foregoing, the
rights of any indemnified person under the resolution of the Executive Committee
of GS Group, adopted on May 12, 1997 (the "Resolution")


                                       -8-
<PAGE>   9
shall remain in full force and effect insofar as an indemnified person has any
rights thereunder with respect to the acts, omissions and status of such person
through the date of this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
Instrument shall constitute notice, effective as of the date of this Instrument,
that the Resolution is rescinded insofar as it relates to the acts, omissions
and status of such person after the date of this Instrument.

         9. Arbitration. (a)Subject to the provisions of the second paragraph of
Section 1 and Section 9(b) hereof, any dispute, controversy or claim between an
Indemnitee and GS Inc. arising out of or relating to or concerning the
provisions of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in New York
City before, and in accordance with the rules then obtaining of, the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") or, if the NYSE declines to arbitrate the matter,
the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") in accordance with the
commercial arbitration rules of the AAA.

         (b) Notwithstanding the provision of Section 9(a) and in addition to
its right to submit any dispute or controversy to arbitration, GS Inc. may bring
an action or special proceeding in a state or federal court of competent
jurisdiction sitting in the State of Delaware, whether or not an arbitration
proceeding has theretofore been or is ever initiated, for the purpose of
temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enforcing the provisions of this
Agreement or to enforce an arbitration award, and, for the purposes of this
Section 9(b), each Indemnitee (i) expressly consents to the application of
Section 9(c) hereof to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof
shall not be required that


                                       -9-
<PAGE>   10
monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be
difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate and (iii)
irrevocably appoints each General Counsel of GS Inc., c/o The Corporation Trust
Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware
19801 as such Indemnitee's agent for service of process in connection with any
such action or proceeding, who shall promptly advise such Indemnitee of any such
service of process.

                  (c) (i) EACH INDEMNITEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE
         EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN THE
         STATE OF DELAWARE OVER ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
         RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE
         ARBITRATED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 9(a) HEREOF. This
         includes any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration or to
         enforce an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge that the forum
         designated by this Section 9(c) has a reasonable relation to this
         Agreement, and to the parties' relationship with one another.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude GS Inc.
         from bringing any action or proceeding in any other court for the
         purpose of enforcing the provisions of this Section 9.

                  (ii) The agreement of an Indemnitee as to forum is independent
         of the law that may be applied in the action, and each Indemnitee
         agrees to this forum even if the forum may under applicable law choose
         to apply non-forum law. Each Indemnitee hereby waives, to the fullest
         extent permitted by applicable law, any


                                      -10-
<PAGE>   11
         objection which such Indemnitee now or hereafter may have to personal
         jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or
         proceeding in any court referred to in Section 9(c)(i). The parties
         undertake not to commence any action arising out of or relating to this
         Agreement in any forum other than the forum described in this Section
         9(c). The parties agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by
         applicable law, a final and non-appealable judgment in any such suit,
         action or proceeding in any such court shall be conclusive and binding
         upon the parties.

         10. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors, assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by merger or
consolidation), heirs, executors and administrators.

         11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

         12. Amendment. Each party understands that from time to time certain
other persons may become Indemnitees and certain Indemnitees will cease to be
Indemnitees to the extent provided in this Section 12. Accordingly, this
Agreement may be amended by action of GS Inc. from time to time to add
additional Indemnitees, without the approval of any other person other than such
proposed Indemnitees, each of whom shall execute a counterpart of the signature
page of this Agreement. This


                                      -11-
<PAGE>   12
Agreement may also be amended by action of GS Inc. and without the approval of
any other person to remove an Indemnitee; provided that such amendment shall not
be effective unless GS Inc. has provided 30 days prior written notice to the
Indemnitee and, in any event, such amendment shall not affect any rights of such
Indemnitee to be indemnified in respect of Losses associated with the acts,
omissions or status of such Indemnitee through the effective date of such
termination (including the right to subsequent indemnification and expense
advancement and reimbursement relating to such acts, omissions or status).

         13. Waiver of Breach. The failure or delay of a party at any time to
require performance by any other party of any provision of this Agreement, even
if known, shall not affect the right of such party to require performance of
that provision or to exercise any right, power, or remedy hereunder, and any
waiver by any party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
be construed as a waiver of any continuing or succeeding breach of such
provision, a waiver of the provision itself, or a waiver of any right, power, or
remedy under this Agreement. No notice to or demand on any party in any case
shall, of itself, entitle such party to other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances.

         14. Severability. GS Inc. and each Indemnitee agree that the agreements
and provisions contained in this Agreement are severable and divisible, that
each such agreement and provision does not depend upon any other provision or
agreement for its enforceability, and that each such agreement and provision set
forth


                                      -12-
<PAGE>   13
herein constitutes an enforceable obligation between GS Inc. and such
Indemnitee. Consequently, GS Inc. and each Indemnitee hereto agrees that neither
the invalidity nor the unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall
affect the other provisions hereof, and this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and be construed in all respects as if such invalid or
unenforceable provision were omitted.

         15. No Presumption. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding
by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that an Indemnitee
did not meet the applicable standard of conduct for indemnification under this
Agreement.

         16. Notices. Any communication, demand or notice to be given hereunder
will be duly given when delivered in writing by hand or first class mail to GS
Inc. at its principal executive office or to an Indemnitee at its last address
appearing in the business records of GS Inc. (or to such other addresses as a
party may designate by written notice to GS Inc.).

         17. No Assignments. No Indemnitee may assign its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of GS Inc.

         18. No Third Party Rights. Nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any person other than the parties to this
Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to
this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its
provisions are for the sole


                                      -13-
<PAGE>   14
and exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and
permitted assigns.

         19. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

                            INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

                  THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of the 9th day of November 1999, by and between The Goldman
Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("GS Inc."), and each of the
Indemnitees listed on the signature pages to this Agreement (each, an
"Indemnitee", and collectively, the "Indemnitees") as such signature pages may
be amended and supplemented from time to time pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

                                   WITNESSETH

                  WHEREAS, GS Inc. has filed and proposes to file registration
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act
of 1933 (the "Securities Act") for the public offering and sale of securities of
GS Inc., which securities may include shares of its common stock (including
shares to be sold by stockholders of GS Inc. or issuable in connection with
employee benefit plans), debt securities (including medium-term notes),
warrants, preferred stock and/or any other securities of GS Inc. approved by, or
pursuant to action of, the Board of Directors of GS Inc.;

                  WHEREAS, GS Inc. has in the past requested and will in the
future request certain of the Indemnitees to execute registration statements in
the capacity or capacities listed, or to be listed, in registration statements
and to take actions in connection with registration statements; and

                  WHEREAS, each Indemnitee is one of the following: (i) an
officer or director of GS Inc. or (ii) a person requested or authorized by the
Board of Directors of GS Inc. or any committee thereof to take actions on behalf
of GS Inc. in connection with a registration statement.

                  NOW, therefore, in consideration of each Indemnitee's acting
and agreeing to act in the capacities referred to above, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

                  1. General. GS Inc. will indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnitee against any Losses (as hereinafter defined), joint or several, to
which such Indemnitee may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement (as defined below) or any preliminary
prospectus, prospectus, or prospectus supplement comprising a part thereof or
relating thereto, or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing
documents (collectively, the "Offering Documents") or any untrue or alleged
untrue oral statement relating to any offering contemplated by any Offering
<PAGE>   2
Document, or arise out of or are based upon an omission or alleged omission to
state in any Offering Document or such oral statement a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any Offering
Document or such oral statement not misleading; provided, however, that GS Inc.
shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such Losses arise
out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission relating to such Indemnitee made in any Offering
Document or such oral statement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information relating to such Indemnitee furnished to GS Inc. by such Indemnitee
expressly for use therein. "Registration Statement" means any registration
statement previously filed or hereafter filed by GS Inc. under the Securities
Act on any applicable form (including Forms S-8 and S-4) for the registration of
any securities of GS Inc. under the Securities Act, including, without
limitation, debt and equity securities, guarantees, back-up undertakings,
rights, warrants and options and interests in employee benefit plans, and shall
include any amendment, post-effective or otherwise, thereto and any related
registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462 under the Securities Act.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1, GS
Inc. and each Indemnitee agree that insofar as indemnification for liabilities
arising under the Securities Act may be permitted under this Agreement to an
Indemnitee who is a director, officer or controlling person of GS Inc., in the
event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities is made by such
an Indemnitee (other than the payment by GS Inc. of expenses incurred or paid by
such Indemnitee in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) in
connection with a Registration Statement, GS Inc. will, unless in the opinion of
its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a
court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by
it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and GS Inc. and
such Indemnitee will be governed by the final adjudication of such question.

                  2. Losses. As used in this Agreement, the term "Losses" shall
include, without limitation, damages, losses, claims, judgments, liabilities,
fines, penalties, excise taxes, settlements, and costs, attorneys' fees,
accountants' fees, and disbursements and costs of attachment or similar bonds,
investigation costs, defense preparation costs, costs of preparing for and
presenting evidence or testimony, and any expenses of establishing a right to
indemnification under this Agreement. The term "Losses" shall not include taxes
except to the extent taxes are imposed in respect of payments otherwise made
pursuant to this Agreement, in which case such Indemnitee's Losses shall include
an amount not greater than the net taxes payable (taking into account any
deductions, credits or other tax benefits available to such Indemnitee as a
result of the Losses in respect of which such payment is made and the payment of
the taxes imposed in respect of such payment).



                                       -2-
<PAGE>   3
                  3. Enforcement. Subject to the provisions of the second
paragraph of Section 1 hereof, if a claim or request by an Indemnitee under this
Agreement is not paid by GS Inc. or on its behalf, within thirty (30) days after
a written claim or request has been received by GS Inc. and, if applicable, the
written undertaking in Section 5 hereof has been received by GS Inc., such
Indemnitee may at any time thereafter commence an arbitration proceeding in
accordance with Section 9 hereof against GS Inc. to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim or request and, if successful in whole or in part, such Indemnitee
shall be entitled to be paid also the expenses of prosecuting such proceeding.

                  4. Partial Indemnification; Contribution. If an Indemnitee is
entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by GS Inc. for
some or a portion of any Losses, but not for the total amount thereof, GS Inc.
shall nevertheless indemnify such Indemnitee for the portion of such Losses to
which such Indemnitee is entitled. If the indemnification provided for in this
Agreement is insufficient or unavailable for any reason, GS Inc. shall
contribute to relevant Losses to the maximum extent permitted by law.

                  5. Expenses. Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection
with any proceeding shall be paid by GS Inc. upon request of such Indemnitee
that GS Inc. pay such expenses, but only upon receipt by GS Inc. of (i) a
written undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to reimburse GS Inc. for
expenses if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined that such
indemnification is not permitted by the Securities Act (and that contribution is
unavailable with respect to such payments) and (ii) satisfactory evidence of the
amount of such expenses.

                  6. Notice of Claim. Each Indemnitee shall promptly notify GS
Inc. in writing of any claim against such Indemnitee for which indemnification
will or could be sought under this Agreement. In addition, each Indemnitee shall
give GS Inc. such information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and
as shall be within such Indemnitee's power and at such times and places as are
not unduly burdensome for such Indemnitee.

                  7. Defense of Claim. With respect to any proceeding as to
which an Indemnitee notifies GS Inc. of the commencement thereof:


                  (a) GS Inc. will be entitled to participate at its own
         expense;

                  (b) subject to Section 7(c) hereof, GS Inc. shall not, in
         connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
         jurisdiction against any Indemnitee and any other Indemnitees, be
         liable to such Indemnitee and such other Indemnitees for the fees and
         expenses of


                                       -3-
<PAGE>   4
         more than one separate law firm (in addition to a single firm of local
         counsel);

                  (c) except as otherwise provided below, to the extent that it
         may wish, GS Inc. will be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with
         counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee, which in GS Inc.'s
         sole discretion may be regular counsel to GS Inc. and may be counsel to
         other Indemnitees. The Indemnitees also shall have the right to employ
         one separate counsel for such Indemnitees in such action, suit or
         proceeding if such Indemnitees reasonably conclude that if they did not
         there would be a conflict of interest between GS Inc. and such
         Indemnitees, and under such circumstances the fees and expenses of such
         counsel shall be paid by GS Inc.; and

                  (d) GS Inc. shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnitee
         under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action,
         suit or proceeding effected without GS Inc.'s written consent. GS Inc.
         shall not settle any action, suit or proceeding in any manner which
         would impose any cost or limitation on an Indemnitee or would admit
         fault by an Indemnitee without such Indemnitee's written consent. No
         Indemnitee shall settle any action, suit, or proceeding without the
         prior written consent of GS Inc. Neither GS Inc. nor an Indemnitee will
         unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any proposed settlement.

                  8. Non-exclusivity. The right to indemnification and the
payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this Agreement shall not be exclusive of or affected in
any way by any other right which an Indemnitee may have or hereafter may acquire
under any statute, certificate of incorporation, by-laws, agreement,
arrangement, resolution or instrument providing indemnification or expense
payment, except that any payments otherwise required to be made by GS Inc.
hereunder shall be offset by any and all amounts received by an Indemnitee from
any other indemnitor or under one or more liability insurance policies
maintained by an indemnitor or otherwise and shall not be duplicative of any
other payments received by an Indemnitee from GS Inc. in respect of the matter
giving rise to the indemnity hereunder. When an Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, expense advancement or reimbursement under this Instrument and
any other agreement, arrangement, resolution or instrument of GS Inc., the
Indemnitee may choose to pursue its rights under one or more, but less than all,
of such applicable agreements, arrangements, resolutions or instruments, in
which case such Indemnitee need only comply with the standards and procedures of
the agreements, arrangements, resolutions or instruments under which it chooses
to pursue its rights.

                  9. Arbitration.

                  (a) Subject to the provisions of the second paragraph of
         Section 1 and Section 9(b) hereof, any dispute, controversy or claim
         between an Indemnitee and GS Inc. arising out of or relating to or
         concerning the provisions of this Agreement shall be finally settled by
         arbitration in New York City before, and in accordance with the rules
         then applying of, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") or, if the
         NYSE declines to arbitrate the matter or the matter is not otherwise
         arbitrable before it, the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA")
         in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provision of Section 9(a) and in
         addition to its right to submit any dispute or controversy to
         arbitration, GS Inc. may bring an action or special proceeding in a
         state or federal court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the State
         of Delaware, whether or not an arbitration proceeding has theretofore
         been or is ever initiated, for the purpose of temporarily,
         preliminarily or permanently enforcing the provisions of this Agreement
         or to enforce an arbitration award, and, for the purposes of this
         Section 9(b), each Indemnitee (i) expressly consents to the application
         of Section 9(c) hereof to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees
         that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of
         the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and
         that remedies at law would be inadequate and (iii) irrevocably appoints
         each General Counsel of GS Inc., c/o The Corporation Trust Company,
         Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware
         19801 as such Indemnitee's agent for service of process in connection
         with any such action or proceeding, who shall promptly advise such
         Indemnitee of any such service of process.

                  (c) (i) EACH INDEMNITEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE
         EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN THE
         STATE OF DELAWARE OVER ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
         RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE
         ARBITRATED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 9(a) HEREOF. This
         includes any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration or to
         enforce an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge that the forum
         designated by this Section 9(c) has a reasonable relation to this
         Agreement, and to the parties' relationship with one another.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude GS Inc.
         from bringing any action or proceeding in any other court for the
         purpose of enforcing the provisions of this Section 9.


                                       -5-
<PAGE>   6
                  (ii) The agreement of an Indemnitee as to forum is independent
         of the law that may be applied in the action, and each Indemnitee
         agrees to this forum even if the forum may under applicable law choose
         to apply non-forum law. Each Indemnitee hereby waives, to the fullest
         extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which such Indemnitee
         now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of
         venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any court referred to
         in Section 9(c)(i). The parties undertake not to commence any action
         arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any forum other than
         the forum described in this Section 9(c). The parties agree that, to
         the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a final and
         non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding in any
         such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties.

                  10. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
respective successors, assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by
merger or consolidation), heirs, executors and administrators.

                  11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD
TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

                  12. Amendment. Each party understands that from time to time
certain other persons may become Indemnitees and certain Indemnitees will cease
to be Indemnitees to the extent provided in this Section 12. Accordingly, this
Agreement may be amended by action of GS Inc. from time to time to add
additional Indemnitees, without the approval of any other person other than such
proposed additional Indemnitees, each of whom shall execute a counterpart of the
signature page of this Agreement. This Agreement may also be amended by action
of GS Inc. and without the approval of any other person to remove an Indemnitee;
provided that such amendment shall not be effective unless GS Inc. has provided
30 days prior written notice to the Indemnitee and, in any event, such amendment
shall not affect any rights of such Indemnitee to be indemnified in respect of
Losses associated with the acts, omissions or status of such Indemnitee through
the effective date of such termination (including the right to subsequent
indemnification and expense advancement and reimbursement relating to such acts,
omissions or status).

                  13. Waiver of Breach. The failure or delay of a party at any
time to require performance by any other party of any provision of this
Agreement, even if known, shall not affect the right of such party to require
performance of that provision or to exercise any right, power, or remedy
hereunder, and any waiver by any party of any breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any


                                       -6-

continuing or succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of the provision
itself, or a waiver of any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement. No
notice to or demand on any party in any case shall, of itself, entitle such
party to other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  14. Severability. GS Inc. and each Indemnitee agree that the
agreements and provisions contained in this Agreement are severable and
divisible, that each such agreement and provision does not depend upon any other
provision or agreement for its enforceability, and that each such agreement and
provision set forth herein constitutes an enforceable obligation between GS Inc.
and such Indemnitee. Consequently, GS Inc. and each Indemnitee hereto agrees
that neither the invalidity nor the unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall affect the other provisions hereof, and this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and be construed in all respects as if such
invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted.

                  15. Notices. Any communication, demand or notice to be given
hereunder will be duly given when delivered in writing by hand or first class
mail to GS Inc. at its principal executive office or to an Indemnitee at its
last address appearing in the business records of GS Inc. (or to such other
addresses as a party may designate by written notice to GS Inc.).

                  16. No Assignments. No Indemnitee may assign its rights or
delegate obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
GS Inc. Any assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 16 shall be
null and void.

                  17. No Third Party Rights. Nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement will be construed to give any person other than the parties to
this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and
all of its provisions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and their successors and permitted assigns.

                  18. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

Dear Ruth:

We are very pleased that you have agreed to join the Board of Directors of The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ("GS Inc."), and are writing to set forth the general
terms of your compensation as a director. The terms of your compensation are,
of course, subject to future modification by the Board.

Your term as a director will commence on January 21, 2000 and will run through
the 2000 annual meeting of shareholders of GS Inc.: we propose to nominate you
for a three year term running through the 2003 annual meeting. You have also
been elected a member of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee.

As compensation for your services, you will receive:

  -  a grant upon your appointment on January 21, 2000 of 3,000 fully vested
     restricted stock units ("RSUs") under The Goldman Sachs 1999 Stock
     Incentive Plan (the "SIP");

  -  $35,000 per year (the "Annual Retainer");

  -  $15,000 per year for serving on each of the Board committees of which you
     are a member (the "Committee Fees");

  -  $1,000 for each meeting of the Board or of a Board committee that you
     attend (the "Meeting Fees"); and

The Annual Retainer and the Committee Fees (as well as the Annual RSU Grant)
will be paid annually in arrears in the form of fully vested RSUs unless we
agree otherwise. The RSUs will provide for delivery of shares of common stock on
the last business day in May in the year following your retirement from the
Board.

The Meeting Fees are payable in cash and will be paid to you annually in
arrears.

The number of shares of RSUs you receive in respect of the Annual Retainer and
the Committee Fees will be determined in the same manner as grants to employees.
All RSUs will be subject to the terms and conditions of the SIP and the relevant
award agreements.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

     Goldman Sachs is a global investment banking and securities firm that
provides a wide range of services worldwide to a substantial and diversified
client base.

     Our activities are divided into two segments:

          GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.  This segment comprises Investment Banking,
     which includes Financial Advisory and Underwriting, and Trading and
     Principal Investments, which includes Fixed Income, Currency and
     Commodities (FICC), Equities and Principal Investments (Principal
     Investments primarily represents net revenues from our merchant banking
     investments); and

          ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.  This segment comprises
     Asset Management, Securities Services and Commissions.

     All references to 1999, 1998 and 1997 refer to our fiscal year ended, or
the date, as the context requires, November 26, 1999, November 27, 1998 and
November 28, 1997, respectively.

     When we use the terms "Goldman Sachs," "we" and "our," we mean, prior to
our conversion to corporate form, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries and, after our conversion
to corporate form, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and
its consolidated subsidiaries.

     In this discussion, we have included statements that may constitute
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking
statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our belief
regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently
uncertain and beyond our control. These statements relate to our future plans
and objectives, among other things. By identifying these statements for you in
this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may
differ, possibly materially, from the results indicated in these forward-looking
statements. The factors noted below under "-- Results of Operations -- Certain
Factors That May Affect Our Results of Operations," among others, could cause
actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.

                            INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

     On May 7, 1999, we converted from a partnership to a corporation and
completed our initial public offering. In that offering, we sold 51,000,000
shares of common stock.

                              BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

     We operated in a particularly favorable business environment in 1999, as
global equity and many fixed income markets recovered from the turbulent
conditions of the second half of 1998, though government bond markets in the
United States and Europe experienced a significant rise in yields. The improved
business environment provided a positive climate for our investment banking
activities, as well as for our customer-driven and proprietary trading
activities. Economic and market conditions were also favorable for wealth
creation, which contributed positively to growth in our asset management
businesses.

     The macroeconomic environment in 1999 was particularly healthy in the
United States, where strong economic growth and low unemployment continued to be
combined with low levels of inflation. Major U.S. equity markets reached record
levels during the year as corporate earnings growth was strong and activity in
the new issues and mergers and acquisitions arenas increased markedly. The pace
of economic growth and the restoration of more normal conditions in financial
markets prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates three times during
the second half of 1999, returning interest rates to levels in existence before
the 1998 financial market crisis.

     European equity markets posted solid gains in 1999 as economic growth
improved and cross-border business combinations increased to record levels
following the introduction of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)

                                       24
<PAGE>   2
in January. The new European Central Bank held short-term interest rates at low
levels for most of the year, despite a weakening in the euro against the U.S.
dollar. In Asia, the economic recovery in Japan resulted in an appreciation of
the yen versus the U.S. dollar and led Japanese equity markets higher. Financial
markets throughout Asia benefited from renewed economic growth in the region.

                             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial
markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net
revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and
global economic and market conditions. As a result, period-to-period comparisons
may not be meaningful. In addition, Goldman Sachs' conversion to corporate form
has affected, and will continue to affect, our operating results in several
significant ways:

          1.  FORMER PARTNER COMPENSATION. As a corporation, payments for
     services rendered by managing directors who, prior to our conversion to
     corporate form, were profit participating limited partners are included in
     compensation and benefits expense. In prior years, these payments were
     accounted for as distributions of partners' capital rather than as
     compensation and benefits expense. As a result, our 1998 and 1997
     compensation and benefits expense understate the cost of doing business in
     corporate form.

          2.  ONGOING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  As part of compensation,
     restricted stock units and other forms of stock-based compensation can be
     awarded to employees. Of the total restricted stock units that were granted
     at the end of 1999, approximately 50% require future service as a condition
     to the delivery of the underlying shares of common stock. In accordance
     with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, the restricted stock units
     with future service requirements will generally be recorded as compensation
     expense over the four-year service period following the date of grant as
     follows: 52%, 28%, 14% and 6% in years one, two, three and four,
     respectively.

          3.  AMORTIZATION OF EMPLOYEE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AWARDS.  We have
     recorded, and will continue to record over the five-year vesting period
     following the date of grant, noncash expense related to the amortization of
     certain restricted stock units awarded to employees in connection with our
     initial public offering. These restricted stock units had a value of $1.76
     billion on the date of grant, approximately 26% of which will be amortized
     as a noncash expense, after giving effect to forfeitures, in the 12 months
     following the date of grant. The remaining 74% of the value of these
     restricted stock units will be amortized over the next four years as
     follows: 26%, 26%, 15% and 7% in years two, three, four and five,
     respectively.

          4.  INCOME TAXES.  As a corporation, our operating results have
     become, and will continue to be, subject to U.S. federal, state and local
     corporate income taxes and, therefore, to a higher tax rate than we
     incurred as a partnership. Our effective tax rate for the period from May
     7, 1999 to the end of the fiscal year, excluding the effect of nonrecurring
     items, was 40%.

     For a further discussion of the effect of these items on our actual and pro
forma operating results, see "-- Operating Expenses" and "-- Pro Forma Operating
Results" below and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     As an investment banking and securities firm, our businesses are materially
affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions
generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. The
financial markets in the United States and elsewhere have achieved record or
near record levels, and the favorable business environment in which we have
operated will not continue indefinitely. In the event of a change in market
conditions, our businesses could be adversely affected in many ways, including
the following:

     - We generally maintain large trading and investment positions, including
       merchant banking investments, in the fixed income, currency, commodity
       and equity markets, and in real estate and other assets, and we may incur
       significant losses if market fluctuations or volatility adversely affect
       the value of these positions.

     - Unfavorable financial or economic conditions would likely reduce the
       number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, mergers
       and acquisitions advisory, and other services, and could thereby
       adversely affect our results of operations.

     - A market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of
       transactions that we execute for our cus-

                                       25

       tomers and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from
       commissions and spreads. A market downturn could also result in a decline
       in the fees we earn for managing assets. Moreover, even in the absence of
       a market downturn, below-market performance by our mutual funds could
       result in a decline in assets under management and therefore in the fees
       we receive.

     - Concentration of risk in the past has increased the losses that we have
       incurred in our arbitrage, market-making, block trading, underwriting,
       and lending businesses and may continue to do so in the future. In
       particular, in the case of block trading, we expect the trend toward an
       increase in the number and size of trades to continue.

     - A prolonged market downturn could impair our operating results for a long
       period of time. In such a downturn, our revenues may decline and, if we
       were unable to reduce expenses at the same pace, our profit margins would
       erode.

     If any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize to hedge or
otherwise manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may
incur losses. Our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may
not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market
environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified
or unanticipated.

     Liquidity, i.e., ready access to funds, is essential to our businesses. Our
liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the long-term or
short-term debt capital markets, an inability to access the repurchase and
securities lending markets, or an impairment of our ability to sell assets. Our
ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking
to sell similar assets at the same time. In addition, a reduction in our credit
ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position and
increase our borrowing costs.

     We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities
or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on
their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational
failure or other reasons. The amount and duration of our credit exposures have
been increasing over the past several years. In addition, we have also
experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend credit against less
liquid collateral and price more aggressively the credit risks that we take.
Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and
counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe
may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances
that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a
default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses
or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Goldman
Sachs.

(1) Management believes that for periods prior to our conversion to corporate
    form, the best measure by which to assess Goldman Sachs' profitability is
    pre-tax earnings because, as a partnership, we generally were not subject to
    U.S. federal or state income taxes.

(2) Our pre-tax earnings and net earnings in 1999 were reduced by nonrecurring
    items recognized in connection with our conversion to corporate form. For a
    further discussion of these nonrecurring items, see "-- Operating Expenses"
    and "-- Provision for Taxes" below.

(3) Our pre-tax earnings in 1999 reflect payments for services rendered by
    managing directors who, prior to our conversion to corporate form, were
    profit participating limited partners. In prior years, these payments were
    accounted for as distributions of partners' capital rather than as
    compensation and benefits expense. As a result, these payments are not
    reflected in our operating expenses in 1998 or 1997 and, therefore, the
    pre-tax earnings in these years are not comparable with 1999.

(4) Pro forma disclosures reflect the results of Goldman Sachs as if our
    conversion to corporate form and related transactions had taken place at the
    beginning of 1999. See "-- Pro Forma Operating Results" below for a
    discussion of the pro forma adjustments.

(5) Includes 23 weeks as a partnership and 29 weeks as a corporation.

     1999 VERSUS 1998.  Net revenues were $13.35 billion, an increase of 57%
compared with 1998. Global Capital Markets experienced significant net revenue
growth in both Trading and Principal Investments, as substantially all
components of the business recovered from the global market turmoil of the
second half of 1998, and Investment Banking, where we benefited from
unprecedented levels of activity in mergers and acquisitions and equity new
issues worldwide. Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services
increased 16% compared with 1998, primarily due to growth in assets under
management, increased equities commissions and higher average customer balances
in securities lending and margin lending.

     Our net earnings of $2.71 billion, or $5.57 per diluted share, in 1999 were
reduced by $672 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, due to nonrecurring items
recognized in connection with our conversion to corporate form. For a further
discussion of the nonrecurring charges and benefits affecting our operating
results in 1999, see "-- Operating Expenses" and "-- Provision for Taxes" below.

     1998 VERSUS 1997.  Our net revenues were $8.52 billion in 1998, an increase
of 14% compared with 1997. Net revenue growth was strong in Asset Management and
Securities Services, which increased 43%, primarily due to increased equities
commissions, higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending
and growth in assets under management. Net revenues in Global Capital Markets
increased 4% as strong net revenue growth in Investment Banking, resulting from
higher levels of mergers and acquisitions activity, was substantially offset by
lower net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments, primarily due to a 30%
reduction in FICC net revenues.

     Pre-tax earnings in 1998 were $2.92 billion, a 3% decrease compared with
$3.01 billion in the prior year. This decrease was due to losses incurred in our
Trading and Principal Investments business during the global market turmoil of
the second half of 1998.

(1) Includes the following expenses that have not been allocated to our
    segments: (i) nonrecurring employee initial public offering awards of $2.26
    billion, (ii) the ongoing amortization of employee initial public offering
    awards of $268 million and (iii) a charitable contribution to The Goldman
    Sachs Foundation of $200 million made at the time of our initial public
    offering.

     Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and
expense to specific securities, commodities and other positions in relation to
the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, the underlying positions. Net
interest is allocated to the Trading and Principal Investments component of
Global Capital Markets and the Securities Services component of Asset Management
and Securities Services. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements
for further information regarding our segments.

     The pre-tax earnings of our segments in 1999 reflect payments for services
rendered by managing directors who, prior to our conversion to corporate form,
were profit participating limited partners. In prior years, these payments were
accounted for as distributions of partners' capital rather than as compensation
and benefits expense. As a result, these payments are not reflected in the
operating expenses of our segments in 1998 and 1997 and, therefore, the pre-tax
earnings of our segments in these years are not comparable with 1999.

  GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS

     The components of the Global Capital Markets segment are set forth below:

     INVESTMENT BANKING.  Goldman Sachs provides a broad range of investment
banking services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions,
governments and individuals. Our investment banking activities are divided into
two categories:

     - FINANCIAL ADVISORY.  Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments
       with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense
       activities, restructurings and spin-offs; and

     - UNDERWRITING.  Underwriting includes public offerings and private
       placements of equity and debt securities.

     TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.  Our Trading and Principal Investments
business facilitates transactions with a diverse group of corporations,
financial institutions, governments and individuals and takes proprietary
positions through market making in and trading of fixed income and equity
products, currencies, commodities, and swaps and other derivatives. Trading and
Principal Investments is divided into three categories:

     - FICC.  We make markets in and trade fixed income products, currencies and
       commodities, structure and enter into a wide variety of derivative
       transactions, and engage in proprietary trading and arbitrage activities;

                                       28

<PAGE>   6
     - EQUITIES.  We make markets in and trade equities and equity-related
       products, structure and enter into equity derivative transactions, and
       engage in proprietary trading and equity arbitrage; and

     - PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.  Principal Investments primarily represents net
       revenues from our merchant banking investments.

     Net revenues from Principal Investments do not include management fees and
the increased share of the income and gains from our merchant banking funds to
which Goldman Sachs is entitled when the return on investments exceeds certain
threshold returns to fund investors. These management fees and increased shares
of income and gains are included in the net revenues of Asset Management and
Securities Services.

     Substantially all of our inventory is marked-to-market daily and,
therefore, its value and our net revenues are subject to fluctuations based on
market movements. In addition, net revenues derived from our principal
investments in privately held concerns and in real estate may fluctuate
significantly depending on the revaluation or sale of these investments in any
given period.

Markets segment:

</TABLE>

     1999 VERSUS 1998.  Net revenues in Global Capital Markets were $10.13
billion, an increase of 76% compared with 1998, reflecting substantial growth in
all major components of the business. Pre-tax earnings were $3.90 billion in
1999 compared with $1.77 billion in 1998. Operating expenses increased 57%,
principally due to the inclusion of compensation expense related to services
rendered by managing directors who, prior to our conversion to corporate form,
were profit participating limited partners, higher levels of incentive
compensation commensurate with growth in net revenues, and increased costs
associated with global expansion and higher levels of business activity.

     INVESTMENT BANKING.  Investment Banking generated net revenues of $4.36
billion for the full year, a 29% increase over 1998. Net revenue growth was
strong in both Financial Advisory and Underwriting as our global presence and
strong client base enabled us to capitalize on record levels of global mergers
and acquisitions and new issue activity. Net revenue growth was driven by strong
performances across all regions, particularly in the communications, media and
entertainment, high technology, energy and power, and healthcare sectors.

     Financial Advisory revenues increased 28% compared with 1998. Goldman Sachs
maintained its leading position in the advisory business and benefited from an
increase in mergers and acquisitions activity across many industry sectors, in
both Europe and the United States. Worldwide mergers and acquisitions activity
rose to record levels with transactions valued at over $3 trillion announced
during the period from January 1, 1999 to November 30, 1999.(1) Underwriting
revenues increased 31% compared with 1998. Equity underwriting revenues
benefited from favorable global economic conditions, which led major equity
market indices higher and new issue activity to record levels. Our debt
underwriting business

generally benefited from a more stable economic environment in 1999.

     TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.  Net revenues in Trading and Principal
Investments were $5.77 billion compared with $2.38 billion in 1998, as
substantially all components of the business recovered from the global market
turmoil of the second half of 1998.

     Net revenues in FICC nearly doubled compared with 1998, primarily due to
growth in our credit-sensitive businesses and commodities that was partially
offset by lower net revenues in currencies. The credit-sensitive businesses
(which include high-yield debt, bank loans and investment-grade corporate debt)
benefited from improved economic conditions as credit spreads and market
liquidity returned to more normal levels following the dislocation experienced
during the second half of 1998. Net revenue growth in commodities benefited from
increased customer activity, while reduced activity and volatility in the global
foreign exchange markets contributed to a decline in net revenues from
currencies.

     The significant net revenue growth in Equities was primarily due to
strength in arbitrage and convertibles and increased customer flow in
derivatives and global shares. Net revenue growth in arbitrage and convertibles
was driven by improved market conditions following the turmoil in global markets
during the second half of 1998 and by increased mergers and acquisitions and
other corporate activity. Equity derivatives net revenues were substantially
higher primarily as a result of increased customer activity worldwide. Increased
transaction volumes in global equity markets contributed to the net revenue
growth in our global shares businesses.

     Net revenues from Principal Investments increased dramatically due to
mark-to-market gains on certain merchant banking investments, particularly in
the high technology and telecommunications sectors.

     1998 VERSUS 1997.  Net revenues in Global Capital Markets were $5.75
billion, an increase of 4% compared with 1997, as strong net revenue growth in
Investment Banking was substantially offset by a reduction in net revenues in
Trading and Principal Investments. Pre-tax earnings were $1.77 billion in 1998,
a 23% decrease compared with 1997, as many of our businesses were adversely
affected by market conditions from mid-August 1998 to mid-October 1998.
Operating expenses increased 23%, primarily due to increased compensation
related to growth in employment levels and additional expenses associated with
temporary staff and consultants.

     INVESTMENT BANKING.  Investment Banking achieved net revenues of $3.37
billion in 1998, an increase of 30% compared with 1997. Net revenue growth was
strong in Financial Advisory and, to a lesser extent, in Underwriting as we
capitalized on higher levels of activity in many industry groups, including
communications, media and entertainment, financial institutions, general
industrials and retail. Net revenue growth in Investment Banking was strong in
all major regions in 1998 compared with the prior year.

     Financial Advisory revenues increased 50% compared with 1997, due to
increased revenues from mergers and acquisitions advisory assignments, which
principally resulted from consolidation within various industries and generally
favorable U.S. and European stock markets. Despite a substantial decrease in the
number of industry-wide underwriting transactions in August and September of
1998, Underwriting revenues increased 14% for the year, primarily due to
increased revenues from equity and high-yield corporate debt underwriting
activities.

     TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.  Net revenues in Trading and Principal
Investments were $2.38 billion in 1998, a decrease of 19% compared with 1997.
This decrease in net revenues was concentrated in the second half of the year,
when the Russian economic crisis, the turmoil in Asian and Latin American
emerging markets, and the resulting move to higher credit quality fixed income
securities by many investors led to substantial declines in global financial
markets. For the full year, significant net revenue reductions in FICC and
Principal Investments were partially offset by increased net revenues in
Equities.

     Net revenues in FICC decreased 30% compared with 1997 due to an
extraordinarily difficult environment in the second half of 1998. The net
revenue reduction in FICC was concentrated in fixed income arbitrage and
high-yield debt trading, which experienced losses in 1998 due to a reduction in
liquidity and widening credit spreads in the second half of the year. An
increase in net revenues from market making and trading in fixed income
derivatives, currencies and commodities partially offset this decline.

     Net revenues in Equities increased 39% compared with 1997 as higher net
revenues in derivatives and European shares were partially offset by losses in
equity arbitrage. The derivatives business generated significantly higher

                                       30
<PAGE>   8
net revenues due, in part, to strong customer demand for over-the-counter
products, particularly in Europe. Net revenues from European shares increased as
Goldman Sachs benefited from generally favorable equity markets and increased
customer demand. The equity arbitrage losses were due principally to the
underperformance of various equity positions versus their benchmark hedges, to
widening of spreads in a variety of relative value trades, and to lower prices
for event-oriented securities resulting from a reduction in announced mergers
and acquisitions and other corporate activity in the second half of 1998.

     Net revenues from Principal Investments declined 51% compared with 1997 as
investments in certain publicly held companies decreased in value during the
second half of 1998. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in gains
on the disposition of investments compared with the prior year.

ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

     The components of the Asset Management and Securities Services segment are
set forth below:

     - ASSET MANAGEMENT.  Asset Management generates management fees by
       providing investment advisory services to a diverse client base of
       institutions and individuals;

     - SECURITIES SERVICES.  Securities Services includes prime brokerage,
       financing services and securities lending, and our matched book
       businesses, all of which generate revenue primarily in the form of fees
       or interest rate spreads; and

     - COMMISSIONS.  Commissions includes agency transactions for clients on
       major stock and futures exchanges and revenues from the increased share
       of the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds.

     The following table sets forth the net revenues of our Asset Management and

     Our assets under supervision consist of assets under management and other
client assets. Assets under management typically generate fees based on a
percentage of their value and include our mutual funds, separate accounts
managed for institutional and individual investors, our merchant banking funds
and other alternative investment funds. Other client assets consist of assets in
brokerage accounts of primarily high-net-worth individuals, on which we earn
commissions.

     1999 VERSUS 1998.  Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services
were $3.21 billion, an increase of 16% compared with 1998. All major components
of the business contributed to the net revenue growth in 1999. Pre-tax earnings
in Asset Management and Securities Services were $817 million in 1999 compared
with

                                       31
<PAGE>   9

$1.15 billion in 1998. Operating expenses increased, principally due to the
inclusion of compensation expense related to services rendered by managing
directors who, prior to our conversion to corporate form, were profit
participating limited partners and increased costs associated with the
continuing expansion of the business.

     Asset Management revenues increased 36%, primarily reflecting a 32%
increase in average assets under management as well as favorable changes in the
composition of assets managed. In 1999, approximately 55% of the increase in
assets under management was attributable to net asset inflows, with the
remaining 45% reflecting market appreciation. Securities Services net revenues
increased 6%, due to higher average customer balances in securities lending and
margin lending, partially offset by reduced spreads in our fixed income matched
book. Commissions rose by 11% as fees earned on higher transaction volumes in
global equity markets were partially offset by a reduction in our increased
share of gains from our merchant banking funds.

     1998 VERSUS 1997.  Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services
were $2.77 billion in 1998, an increase of 43% compared with 1997. All major
components of the segment exhibited strong net revenue growth. Pre-tax earnings
were $1.15 billion in 1998, an increase of 58% compared with 1997. Operating
expenses increased 35% as higher employment levels led to increased compensation
and benefits expenses.

     Asset Management revenues increased 47% during this period, reflecting a
41% increase in average assets under management compared with 1997. In 1998,
approximately 80% of the increase in assets under management was attributable to
net asset inflows, with the remaining 20% reflecting market appreciation. Net
revenues from Securities Services increased 50%, primarily due to growth in our
securities borrowing and lending businesses. Commissions increased 38% as
generally strong and highly volatile equity markets resulted in increased
transaction volumes in listed equity securities. Revenues from the increased
share of income and gains from our merchant banking funds also contributed
significantly to the increase in Commissions.

OPERATING EXPENSES

     In recent years, our operating expenses have increased as a result of
numerous factors, including higher levels of employment and compensation,
expansion of our asset management business, increased worldwide activities,
greater levels of business complexity, and additional systems and consulting
costs relating to various technology initiatives.

     Our operating expenses in 1999, excluding the nonrecurring charges
associated with our initial public offering, increased significantly in part
because, as a corporation, payments for services rendered by managing directors
who, prior to our conversion to corporate form, were profit participating
limited partners are included in compensation and benefits expense. In prior
years, these payments were accounted for as distributions of partners' capital
rather than as compensation and benefits expense. As a result, our 1998 and 1997
compensation and benefits expense understate the cost of doing business in
corporate form.

(1) Includes expense of $666 million related to the initial irrevocable
    contribution of shares of common stock to a defined contribution plan.

(2) Excludes employees of Goldman Sachs' property management subsidiaries.
    Substantially all of the costs of these employees are reimbursed to Goldman
    Sachs by the real estate investment funds to which these subsidiaries
    provide property management services.

     1999 VERSUS 1998.  Operating expenses were $11.35 billion in 1999, a
substantial increase over 1998, primarily due to nonrecurring charges associated
with Goldman Sachs' conversion to corporate form and related transactions, the
inclusion of compensation expense related to services rendered by managing
directors who were profit participating limited partners, higher levels of
compensation commensurate with higher net revenues and amortization of employee
initial public offering awards. The nonrecurring charges included $2.26 billion
for employee initial public offering awards and $200 million for the charitable
contribution to The Goldman Sachs Foundation made at the time of our initial
public offering.

     Compensation and benefits expense was $6.46 billion, an increase of 68%
compared with 1998. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was
48% in 1999. Employment levels increased 18% during the year, reflecting growth
in our core businesses. Expenses associated with our temporary staff and
consultants were $430 million in 1999, an increase of 30% compared with 1998,
reflecting increased global expansion and consulting costs associated with
technology initiatives, including preparations for the Year 2000.

     Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 5%, primarily due to higher
transaction volumes in equity derivatives, U.S. and European equities, and
commodities. Market development expenses increased 27%, principally due to
higher levels of business activity and increased spending on advertising.
Communications and technology expenses increased 15%, reflecting higher
telecommunications and market data costs associated with growth in employment
levels and additional spending on technology initiatives, including preparations
for the Year 2000. Depreciation and amortization increased 39%, due to
additional capital expenditures on leasehold improvements and technology-related
and telecommunications

                                       33

equipment in support of higher levels of business activity. Occupancy expenses
increased 52%, reflecting additional office space needed to accommodate growth
in employment levels. Professional services and other expenses increased 20% due
to Goldman Sachs' increased business activity.

     1998 VERSUS 1997.  Operating expenses were $5.60 billion in 1998, an
increase of 26% over 1997, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits
expense.

     Compensation and benefits increased as a percentage of net revenues to 45%
from 42% in 1997, principally as a result of increases in employment levels and
in expenses associated with temporary staff and consultants. Employment levels
increased 23% during the year, with particularly strong growth in asset
management. Expenses associated with our temporary staff and consultants were
$330 million in 1998, an increase of 85% compared with 1997, reflecting greater
business activity, Goldman Sachs' global expansion, and consulting costs
associated with various technology initiatives, including preparations for the
Year 2000 and the establishment of the EMU.

     Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 19%, primarily due to
higher transaction volumes in European and U.S. equities and futures contracts.
Market development expenses increased 39% and professional services and other
expenses increased 53%, due to higher levels of business activity and Goldman
Sachs' global expansion. Communications and technology expenses increased 27%,
reflecting higher telecommunications and market data costs associated with
higher employment levels and additional spending on technology initiatives.
Depreciation and amortization increased 36%, principally due to capital
expenditures on telecommunications and technology-related equipment and
leasehold improvements. Occupancy expenses increased 23%, reflecting additional
office space needed to accommodate higher employment levels.

PROVISION FOR TAXES

     The net tax benefit of $716 million in 1999 included nonrecurring net
benefits of $1.78 billion recognized during the second quarter. These
nonrecurring net benefits included $825 million related to our conversion to
corporate form, $880 million related to the granting of employee initial public
offering awards and $80 million related to the contribution of $200 million to
The Goldman Sachs Foundation made at the time of our initial public offering.
Goldman Sachs' effective tax rate for the period from May 7, 1999 to the end of
1999, excluding the effect of these nonrecurring items, was 40%. Our effective
tax rate can vary from year to year depending on, among other factors, the
geographic and business mix of our earnings. See Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements for further information regarding our provision for taxes.

     Prior to our conversion to corporate form, we generally were not subject to
U.S. federal and state income taxes. As a partnership, we were primarily subject
to local unincorporated business taxes and taxes in non-U.S. jurisdictions on
certain of our operations.

     BASIS OF PRESENTATION.  The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
earnings was prepared as if our conversion to corporate form and related
transactions had taken place at the beginning of 1999.

     For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges,
"earnings" represent pre-tax earnings plus fixed charges and "fixed charges"
represent interest expense plus that portion of rent expense that, in our
opinion, approximates the interest factor included in rent expense.

     The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain
assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The pro forma condensed
consolidated statement of earnings and accompanying notes should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and their notes.

     The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of earnings is not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations that might have occurred had
our conversion to corporate form and related transactions actually taken place
at the beginning of 1999, or that may be expected to occur in the future.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     (a) Adjustment to reflect the additional interest expense on junior
subordinated debentures issued to retired limited partners in exchange for their
interests in The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and certain affiliates.

     (b) Adjustment to eliminate the nonrecurring effect of the expense related
to restricted stock units, awarded to employees in connection with our
conversion to corporate form, for which future service is not required as a
condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock, and the initial
irrevocable contribution of shares of common stock to our defined contribution
plan.

     (c) Adjustment to reflect additional amortization for the full fiscal year
related to certain restricted stock units awarded to employees in connection
with our conversion to corporate form, which vest in equal installments in years
three, four and five following the date of grant (May 7, 1999). These restricted
stock units had a value of $1.76 billion at date of grant, approximately 26% of
which will be amortized as a noncash expense, after giving effect to
forfeitures, in the 12 months following the date of grant. The remaining 74% of
the value of these restricted stock units will be amortized over the next four
years as follows: 26%, 26%, 15% and 7% in years two, three, four and five,
respectively.

     (d) Adjustment to eliminate the expense related to the charitable
contribution to The Goldman Sachs Foundation made at the time of our initial
public offering.

     (e) Adjustment to reflect a pro forma provision for taxes for Goldman Sachs
in corporate form at an effective tax rate of 40%.

     (f) Adjustment to reflect the effect of share activity, primarily related
to the acquisition of The Hull Group in September 1999, which is averaged over
the period beginning on May 4, 1999 (the day trading in our common stock
commenced) for actual purposes, and over the entire year for pro forma purposes.

     (g) Adjustment to diluted average common shares outstanding, which includes
both common stock and nonvoting common stock outstanding, to reflect the
additional dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable pursuant to the
restricted stock units and stock options, awarded to employees in connection
with our conversion to corporate form, for which future service is required as a
condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock. For purposes of
calculating pro forma diluted average common shares outstanding, we used the
initial public offering price of $53 per share from the beginning of 1999 until
May 4, 1999. Thereafter, we used actual daily closing prices.

                                GEOGRAPHIC DATA

     For a summary of the net revenues, pre-tax earnings and identifiable assets
of Goldman Sachs by geographic region, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial
statements.

                                   CASH FLOWS

     Our cash flows are primarily related to the operating and financing
activities undertaken in connection with our trading and market-making
transactions.

     YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 1999.  Cash and cash equivalents increased to $3.06
billion in 1999. Cash of $12.59 billion was used for operating activities,
primarily to fund higher net trading assets due to increased levels of business
activity. Cash of $654 million was used for investing activities, primarily for
the purchase of telecommunications and technology-related equipment, leasehold
improvements and the acquisition of The Hull Group in September 1999. Financing
activities provided $13.46 billion of cash, reflecting an increase in long-term
borrowings and net repurchase agreements, and proceeds from the issuance of
common stock.

     YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 1998.  Cash and cash equivalents increased to $2.84
billion in 1998. Cash of $62 million was provided by operating activities. Cash
of $656 million was used for investing activities, primarily for leasehold
improvements and the purchase of telecommunications and technology-related
equipment and certain financial instruments. Financing activities provided $2.10
billion of cash, reflecting an increase in the net issuance of long-term and
short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in net repurchase
agreements, distributions to partners, cash outflows related to partners'
capital allocated for income taxes and potential withdrawals, and the
termination of our profit participation plans.

     YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 1997.  Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $1.33
billion in 1997. Operating activities provided cash of $70 million. Cash of $693
million was used for investing activities, primarily for the purchase of certain
financial instruments and technology-related equipment. Cash of $258 million was
used for financing activities, principally due to a decrease in net repurchase
agreements, distributions to partners, and cash outflows related to partners'
capital allocated for income taxes and potential withdrawals, partially offset
by the net issuance of long-term and short-term borrowings.

                                   LIQUIDITY

MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT OF LIQUIDITY

     Management believes that one of the most important issues for a company in
the financial services sector is access to liquidity. Accordingly, Goldman Sachs
has established a comprehensive structure to oversee its liquidity and funding
policies.

     The Finance Committee has responsibility for establishing and assuring
compliance with our asset and liability management policies and has oversight
responsibility for managing liquidity risk, the size and composition of our
balance sheet, and our credit ratings. See "-- Risk Management -- Risk
Management Structure" below for a further description of the committees that
participate in our risk management process. The Finance Committee meets monthly,
and more often when necessary, to evaluate our liquidity position and funding
requirements.

     Our Treasury Department manages our capital structure, funding, liquidity,
and relationships with creditors and rating agencies on a global basis. The
Treasury Department works jointly with our global funding desk in managing our
borrowings. The global funding desk is primarily responsible for our
transactional short-term funding activity.

LIQUIDITY POLICIES

     In order to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity, management has
implemented several liquidity policies as outlined below.

     DIVERSIFICATION OF FUNDING SOURCES AND LIQUIDITY PLANNING.  Goldman Sachs
seeks to maintain diversified funding sources with both banks and nonbank
lenders globally. Management believes that Goldman Sachs' relationships with its
lenders are critical to its liquidity.

     Goldman Sachs also has access to diversified funding sources with numerous
creditors, including banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, bank trust
departments and other asset managers. We monitor our creditors to maintain broad
and diversified credit.

     We access liquidity in a variety of markets in the United States as well as
in Europe and Asia. We make extensive use of the repurchase agreement markets
and have raised debt publicly as well as in the private placement and commercial
paper markets, and through Eurobonds, money broker loans, commodity-based
financings, letters of credit and promissory notes. We seek to structure our
liabilities to avoid significant amounts of debt coming due on any one day or
during any single week or year. In addition, we maintain and update annually a
liquidity crisis plan that provides guidance in the event of a liquidity crisis.
The annual update of this plan is reviewed and approved by our Finance
Committee.

     ASSET LIQUIDITY.  Goldman Sachs maintains a highly liquid balance sheet.
Many of our assets are readily funded in the repurchase agreement markets, which
generally have proven to be a consistent source of funding, even in periods of
market stress. A substantial portion of our inventory turns over rapidly and is
marked-to-market daily. We maintain long-term borrowings and stockholders'
equity substantially in excess of our less liquid assets.

     DYNAMIC LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT. Goldman Sachs seeks to manage the composition
of its asset base and the maturity profile of its funding to ensure that it can
liquidate its assets prior to its liabilities coming due, even in times of
liquidity stress. We have traditionally been able to fund our liquidity needs
through security-based and collateralized funding, such as repurchase
transactions and securities lending, as well as short-term and long-term
borrowings and equity capital. To further evaluate the adequacy of our liquidity
management policies and guidelines, we perform weekly "stress funding"
simulations of disruptions to our access to unsecured credit.

                                       37

<PAGE>   15


     EXCESS LIQUIDITY.  In addition to maintaining a highly liquid balance sheet
and a significant amount of longer term liabilities to assure liquidity even
during adverse conditions, we seek to maintain a liquidity cushion that consists
principally of unencumbered U.S. government and agency obligations to ensure the
availability of immediate liquidity. This pool of highly liquid assets averaged
$17.99 billion during 1999 and $14.17 billion during 1998.

     LIQUIDITY RATIO MAINTENANCE.  It is Goldman Sachs' policy to further manage
its liquidity by maintaining a "liquidity ratio" of at least 100%. This ratio
measures the relationship between the loan value of our unencumbered assets and
our short-term unsecured liabilities. The maintenance of this liquidity ratio is
intended to ensure that we could fund our positions on a fully secured basis in
the event that we were unable to replace our unsecured debt maturing within one
year. Under this policy, we seek to maintain unencumbered assets in an amount
that, if pledged or sold, would provide the funds necessary to replace unsecured
obligations that are scheduled to mature (or where holders have the option to
redeem) within the coming year.

     INTERCOMPANY FUNDING.  Most of the liquidity of Goldman Sachs is raised by
the parent company, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The parent company then lends
the necessary funds to its subsidiaries and affiliates. We carefully manage our
intercompany exposure by generally requiring intercompany loans to have
maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings
of the parent company. This policy ensures that the subsidiaries' obligations to
the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent company's
third-party long-term borrowings. In addition, many of the advances made to our
subsidiaries and affiliates are secured by marketable securities or other liquid
collateral. We generally fund our equity investments in subsidiaries with equity
capital.

THE BALANCE SHEET

     Goldman Sachs maintains a highly liquid balance sheet that fluctuates
significantly between financial statement dates. In the fourth quarter of 1998,
we temporarily decreased our total assets to reduce risk and increase liquidity
in response to difficult conditions in the global financial markets. The
following table sets forth our total assets, adjusted assets, leverage ratios
and book value per share:

     As of November 1999 and November 1998, we held $2.62 billion and $2.21
billion, respectively, in high-yield debt and emerging market securities and
$1.80 billion and $1.59 billion, respectively, in bank loans. These assets may
be relatively illiquid during times of market stress. We seek to diversify our
holdings of these assets by industry and by geographic location.

     As of November 1999, the aggregate carrying value of our principal
investments held directly or through our merchant banking funds was $2.88
billion, which consisted of corporate principal investments with an aggregate
carrying value of $1.95 billion and real estate investments with an aggregate
carrying value of $928 million.

CREDIT RATINGS

     Goldman Sachs relies upon the debt capital markets to fund a significant
portion of its day-to-day operations. The cost and availability of debt
financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important
to us when competing in certain markets and when seeking to engage in longer
term transactions, including over-the-counter derivatives. A reduction in our
credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the

                                       38
<PAGE>   16
capital markets. This, in turn, could reduce our earnings and adversely affect
our liquidity.

     The following table sets forth our credit ratings as of November 1999:

LONG-TERM DEBT

     As of November 1999, our consolidated long-term borrowings were $20.95
billion. Substantially all of these borrowings were unsecured and consisted
principally of senior borrowings with maturities extending to 2024. The weighted
average maturity of our long-term borrowings as of November 1999 was
approximately five years. Substantially all of our long-term borrowings are
swapped into U.S. dollar obligations with short-term floating rates of interest
in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange
movements. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further
information regarding our long-term borrowings.

                             REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

     Many of our principal subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in
the United States and elsewhere. Goldman, Sachs & Co., a registered U.S.
broker-dealer, is regulated by the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the Chicago Board of Trade, the NYSE and the NASD. Goldman Sachs
International, a registered U.K. broker-dealer, is subject to regulation by the
Securities and Futures Authority Limited and the Financial Services Authority.
Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd., a Tokyo-based broker-dealer, is subject to
regulation by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the Financial Supervisory
Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Tokyo International Financial Futures
Exchange and the Japan Securities Dealers Association. Several other
subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs are regulated by securities, investment advisory,
banking, and other regulators and authorities around the world, such as the
Bundesbank of Germany. Compliance with the rules of these regulators may prevent
us from receiving distributions, advances or repayment of liabilities from these
subsidiaries. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further
information regarding our regulated subsidiaries.

                                RISK MANAGEMENT

     Goldman Sachs has a comprehensive risk management process to monitor,
evaluate and manage the principal risks assumed in conducting its activities.
These risks include market, credit, liquidity, operational, legal and
reputational exposures.

RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

     Goldman Sachs seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a
variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational and legal
reporting systems. We believe that we have effective procedures for evaluating
and managing the market, credit and other risks to which we are exposed.
Nonetheless, the effectiveness of our policies and procedures for managing risk
exposure can never be completely or accurately predicted or fully assured. For
example, unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more
markets or other unforeseen developments can have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition. The consequences of these
developments can include losses due to adverse changes in inventory values,
decreases in the liquidity of trading positions, higher volatility in our
earnings, increases in our credit exposure to customers and counterparties, and
increases in general systemic risk.

     Goldman Sachs has established risk control procedures at several levels
throughout the organization. Trading desk managers have the first line of
responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have
in-depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their individual markets
and the instruments available to hedge our exposures.

     In addition, a number of committees are responsible for establishing
trading limits, for monitoring adherence to these limits and for general
oversight of our risk management process. These committees, which are described
below, meet regularly and consist of senior members of

                                       39
<PAGE>   17
both our revenue-producing units and departments that are independent of our
revenue-producing units.

     MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE.  All risk control functions ultimately report to the
Management Committee. Through both direct and delegated authority, the
Management Committee approves all of Goldman Sachs' operating activities,
trading risk parameters, and customer review guidelines.

     RISK COMMITTEES.  The Firmwide Risk Committee:

     - reviews the activities of existing businesses;

     - approves new businesses and products;

     - approves divisional market risk limits and reviews business unit market
       risk limits;

     - approves inventory position limits for selected country exposures and
       business units;

     - approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings
       group; and

     - reviews scenario analyses based on abnormal or "catastrophic" market
       movements.

     The FICC Risk Committee sets market risk limits for individual business
units and sets issuer-specific net inventory position limits. The Equities Risk
Committee sets market risk limits for individual business units that consist of
gross and net inventory position limits and, for equity derivatives, limits
based on market move scenario analyses. The Asset Management Control Oversight
and the Asset Management Risk committees oversee various operational, credit,
pricing and business practice issues.

     GLOBAL COMPLIANCE AND CONTROL COMMITTEE.  The Global Compliance and Control
Committee provides oversight of our compliance and control functions, including
internal audit; reviews our legal, reputational, operational and control risks;
and periodically reviews the activities of existing businesses.

     COMMITMENTS COMMITTEE.  The Commitments Committee approves equity and non-
investment-grade debt underwriting commitments, loans extended by Goldman Sachs,
and unusual financing structures and transactions that involve significant
capital exposure. The Commitments Committee has delegated to the Credit
Department the authority to approve underwriting commitments for
investment-grade debt and certain other products.

     CREDIT POLICY COMMITTEE.  The Credit Policy Committee establishes and
reviews broad credit policies and parameters that are implemented by the Credit
Department.

     FINANCE COMMITTEE.  The Finance Committee is responsible for oversight of
our capital, liquidity and funding needs and for setting certain inventory
position limits.

     Segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of
our risk management process. In addition to the committees described above,
departments that are independent of the revenue-producing units, such as the
Firmwide Risk, Credit, Controllers, Global Operations, Central Compliance,
Management Controls and Legal departments, in part perform risk management
functions, which include monitoring, analyzing and evaluating risk. Furthermore,
the Controllers Department, in conjunction with the Firmwide Risk Department,
independently reviews, on a regular basis, internal valuation models and the
pricing of positions determined by individual business units.

RISK LIMITS

     Business unit risk limits are established by the various risk committees
and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading
desks.

     Market risk limits are monitored on a daily basis by the Firmwide Risk
Department and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee. Limit
violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and the appropriate
business unit managers.

     Inventory position limits are monitored by the Controllers Department and
position limit violations are reported to the appropriate business unit managers
and the Finance Committee. When inventory position limits are used to monitor
market risk, they are also monitored by the Firmwide Risk Department, and
violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee.

MARKET RISK

     The potential for changes in the market value of our trading positions is
referred to as "market risk." Our trading positions result from underwriting,
market-making and proprietary trading activities.

     Categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates, currency
rates, equity prices and commodity prices.

                                       40
<PAGE>   18

<PAGE>   19
     A description of each market risk category is set forth below:

     - Interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the
       level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest
       rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads.

     - Currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices,
       forward prices and volatilities of currency rates.

     - Equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and
       volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and equity indices.

     - Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices,
       forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as electricity,
       natural gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and precious and base metals.

     We seek to manage these risk exposures through diversifying exposures,
controlling position sizes and establishing hedges in related securities or
derivatives. For example, we may hedge a portfolio of common stock by taking an
offsetting position in a related equity-index futures contract. The ability to
manage an exposure may, however, be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity
of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price
movements between the security and related hedge instrument.

     In addition to applying business judgment, senior management uses a number
of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk. These tools
include:

     - risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred
       to as Value-at-Risk (VaR);

     - risk limits based on a scenario analysis that measures the potential
       effect on our trading net revenues of a significant widening of credit
       spreads;

     - inventory position limits for selected business units and country
       exposures; and

     - scenario analyses that measure the potential effect on our trading net
       revenues of abnormal market movements.

     We also estimate the broader potential impact of certain macroeconomic
scenarios, including a sustained downturn, on our investment banking and
merchant banking activities.

     VAR.  VaR is the potential loss in value of Goldman Sachs' trading
positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a
specified confidence level.

     For the VaR numbers reported below, a one-day time horizon and a 95%
confidence level were used. This means that there is a one in 20 chance that
daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net
revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported VaR. Thus, shortfalls
from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the
reported VaR would be anticipated to occur, on average, about once a month.
Shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported VaR by significant amounts.
Shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of
consecutive trading days.

     The VaR numbers below are shown separately for interest rate, currency,
equity and commodity products, as well as for our overall trading positions.
These VaR numbers include the underlying product positions and related hedges,
which may include positions in other product areas. For example, the hedge of a
foreign exchange forward may include an interest rate futures position and the
hedge of a long corporate bond position may include a short position in the
related equity.

     The modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves
a number of assumptions and approximations. While management believes that these
assumptions and approximations are reasonable, there is no uniform industry
methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions and/or approximations
could produce materially different VaR estimates.

     We use historical data to estimate our VaR, and, to better reflect asset
volatilities and correlations, these historical data are weighted to give
greater importance to more recent observations. Given its reliance on historical
data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which
there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An
inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors, even
when weighted toward more recent observations, may not produce accurate
predictions of future market risk. Moreover, VaR calculated for a one-day time
horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be
liquidated or offset with hedges within one day.

                                       41
<PAGE>   20


     VaR also should be evaluated in light of the methodology's other
limitations. For example, when calculating the VaR numbers shown below, we
assume that asset returns are normally distributed. Nonlinear risk exposures on
options and the potentially mitigating impact of intraday changes in related
hedges would likely produce nonnormal asset returns. Different distributional
assumptions could produce a materially different VaR.

     The following table sets forth the daily VaR for substantially all of our
trading positions:

Description of VaR Chart: Depicted on page 42 of the Annual Report is a chart
setting forth the daily VaR for substantially all of our trading positions
during 1999. The horizontal axis is marked to indicate the start of each
fiscal quarter. The vertical axis is marked to indicate VaR in millions of
dollars. The values displayed in the chart start the fiscal year at $43 million,
and end the fiscal year at $25 million. The maximum VaR, of approximately $56
million, was reached on February 16, 1999, and the minimum VaR, of
approximately $23 million, was reached on November 24, 1999.

     The general decline in our VaR during 1999 reflects lower levels of market
volatility and a decrease in trading exposures, particularly with respect to
interest rates. As described above, the historical data used to estimate VaR is
weighted to give greater importance to more recent observations and,
accordingly, our VaR levels in the beginning of 1999 were significantly affected
by the market turmoil of the second half of 1998.

     As part of our overall risk control process, daily trading net revenues are
compared with the VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. During
1999, trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our 95% one-day VaR on
only one occasion.

NONTRADING RISK

     The market risk on our nontrading financial instruments, including our
merchant banking investments, is measured using a sensitivity analysis that
estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a 10%
decline in the S&P 500. This sensitivity analysis is based on certain
assumptions regarding the relationship between changes in the S&P 500 and
changes in the fair value of the individual nontrading financial instruments.
Different assumptions could produce materially different risk estimates. As of
November 1999, our nontrading market risk was approximately $200 million.

CREDIT RISK

     Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty, or
an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold, fails to perform under its
contractual obligations to us. To reduce our credit exposures, we seek to enter
into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables
and payables with such counterparties. In addition, we attempt to further reduce
credit risk by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from
a counterparty or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after
specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit-related events, by
seeking third-party guarantees of the counterparty's obligations, and through
the use of credit derivatives.

     For most businesses, counterparty credit limits are established by the
Credit Department, which is independent of the revenue-producing departments,
based on guidelines set by the Firmwide Risk and Credit Policy committees. For
most products, we measure and limit credit exposures by reference to both
current and potential exposure. We measure potential exposure based on projected
worst-case market movements over the life of a transaction

                                       43
<PAGE>   22
within a 95% confidence interval. We further seek to measure credit exposure
through the use of scenario analyses and other quantitative tools. Our global
credit management systems monitor current and potential credit exposure to
individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their
affiliates. The systems also provide management, including the Firmwide Risk and
Credit Policy committees, with information regarding overall credit risk by
product, industry sector, country and region.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

     Derivative contracts are financial instruments, such as futures, forwards,
swaps or option contracts, that derive their value from underlying assets,
indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors. Derivative
instruments may be entered into by Goldman Sachs in privately negotiated
contracts, which are often referred to as over-the-counter derivatives, or they
may be listed and traded on an exchange.

     Most of our derivative transactions are entered into for trading purposes.
We use derivatives in our trading activities to facilitate customer
transactions, to take proprietary positions and as a means of risk management.
We also enter into nontrading derivative contracts to manage the interest rate
and currency exposure on our long-term borrowings.

     Derivatives are used in many of our businesses, and we believe that the
associated market risk can only be understood relative to the underlying assets
or risks being hedged, or as part of a broader trading strategy. Accordingly,
the market risk of derivative positions is managed with all of our other
nonderivative risk.

     Derivative contracts are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis on our
consolidated statements of financial condition where management believes a legal
right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. For an
over-the-counter derivative, our credit exposure is directly with our
counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract.

     The following table sets forth the distribution, by credit rating, of
substantially all of our credit exposure with respect to over-the-counter
derivatives as of November 1999, after taking into consideration the effect of
netting agreements. The categories shown reflect our internally determined
public rating agency equivalents.

(1) In lieu of making an individual assessment of the credit of unrated
    counterparties, we make a determination that the collateral held in respect
    of such obligations is sufficient to cover a substantial portion of our
    exposure. In making this determination, we take into account various
    factors, including legal uncertainties and market volatility.

(2) Collateral consists predominantly of cash and U.S. government and agency
    securities and is usually received under agreements entitling Goldman Sachs
    to require additional collateral upon specified increases in exposure or the
    occurrence of adverse credit events.

     Derivative transactions may also involve the legal risk that they are not
authorized or appropriate for a counterparty, that documentation has not been
properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the
counterparty. We attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel
on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a
counterparty to effect the derivative transaction.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

     OPERATIONAL RISK.  Goldman Sachs may face reputational damage, financial
loss or regulatory risk in the event of an operational failure or error. A
systems failure or failure to enter a trade properly into our records may result
in an inability to settle transactions in a timely manner or a breach of
regulatory requirements. Settlement errors or delays may cause losses due to
damages owed to counterparties or movements in prices. These operational and
systems risks may arise in connection with our own systems or as a result of the
failure of an agent acting on our behalf.

     The Global Operations Department is responsible for establishing,
maintaining and approving policies and controls with respect to the accurate
inputting and processing of transactions, clearance and settlement of
transactions, the custody of securities and other instruments, and the detection
and prevention of employee errors or improper or fraudulent activities. Its
personnel work closely with Information Technology in creating systems to enable
appropriate supervision and management of its policies. The Global Operations
Department is also responsible, together with other areas of Goldman Sachs,
including the Legal and Compliance departments, for ensuring compliance with
applicable regulations with respect to the clearance and settlement of
transactions and the margining of positions. The Network Management Department
oversees our relationships with our clearance and settlement agents, regularly
reviews agents' performance and meets with these agents to review operational
issues.

     YEAR 2000.  Goldman Sachs has dedicated resources over the past several
years to address the potential hardware, software, and other computer and
technology issues and related concerns associated with the transition to the
Year 2000 and to confirm that our service providers took similar measures. As a
result of those efforts, we have not experienced any material disruptions in our
operations in connection with, or following, the transition to the Year 2000. We
currently estimate that our Year 2000 costs will total approximately $185
million, of which $170 million had been spent through November 1999.

                            ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

     In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133 -- an amendment of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133," which deferred to fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000 the effective date of the accounting and reporting
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133. Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for
hedging activities. This Statement requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
condition and measure those instruments at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on its intended use
and the resulting designation. We intend to adopt the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 deferred by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 137 in fiscal 2001 and are currently assessing their
effect.

     In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position No. 98-1,
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998.
Statement of Position No. 98-1 requires that certain costs of computer software
developed or obtained for internal use be capitalized and amortized over the
useful life of the related software. We previously expensed the cost of all
software development in the period it was incurred. The adoption of Statement of
Position No. 98-1 is not expected to have a material effect on our results of
operations or financial condition. We intend to adopt the provisions of
Statement of Position No. 98-1 in fiscal 2000.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Directors and Shareholders,
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:

     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition and the related consolidated statements of earnings, changes in
stockholders' equity and partners' capital, cash flows and comprehensive income
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "firm") as of November 26,
1999 and November 27, 1998, and the results of their consolidated operations and
their consolidated cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended November 26, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the firm's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1/DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

     The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.), a Delaware corporation,
together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the firm), is a
global investment banking and securities firm that provides a wide range of
financial services worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base. On
May 7, 1999, the firm converted from a partnership to a corporation and
completed its initial public offering.

     The firm's activities are divided into two business segments:

     GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.  This segment comprises Investment Banking, which
includes Financial Advisory and Underwriting, and Trading and Principal
Investments, which includes Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC),
Equities and Principal Investments (Principal Investments primarily represents
net revenues from the firm's merchant banking investments); and

     ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.  This segment comprises Asset
Management, Securities Services and Commissions.

NOTE 2/SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Group Inc.
and its U.S. and international subsidiaries including Goldman, Sachs & Co.
(GS&Co.) and J. Aron & Company in New York, Goldman Sachs International (GSI) in
London and Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. (GSJL) in Tokyo. Certain reclassifications
have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year
presentation. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated.

     These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles that require management to make
estimates and assumptions regarding trading inventory valuations, the outcome of
pending litigation, and other matters that affect the consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on
judgment and available information and, consequently, actual results could be
materially different from these estimates.

     Unless otherwise stated herein, all references to 1999, 1998 and 1997 refer
to the firm's fiscal year ended, or the date, as the context requires, November
26, 1999, November 27, 1998 and November 28, 1997, respectively.

  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held
in the ordinary course of business.

  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

     Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase, principally U.S. government, federal agency and
investment-grade non-U.S. sovereign obligations, represent short-term
collateralized financing transactions and are carried at their contractual
amounts plus accrued interest. These amounts are presented on a net-by-
counterparty basis where management believes a legal right of setoff exists
under an enforceable netting agreement. The firm takes possession of securities
purchased under agreements to resell, monitors the market value of these
securities on a daily basis and obtains additional collateral as appropriate.

     Securities borrowed and loaned are recorded on the statements of financial
condition based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. These
transactions are generally collateralized by either cash, securities or letters
of credit. The firm takes possession of securities borrowed, monitors the market
value of securities loaned and obtains additional collateral as appropriate.
Income or expense is recognized as interest over the life of the transaction.

                                       52

  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     Gains and losses on financial instruments and commission income and related
expenses are recorded on a trade date basis in the consolidated statements of
earnings. The consolidated statement of financial condition as of November 1999
generally reflects purchases and sales of financial instruments, including
agency transactions, on a trade date basis. The consolidated statement of
financial condition as of November 1998 generally reflects these transactions on
a settlement date basis. Recording these transactions on a trade date basis
would not have resulted in a material adjustment to the consolidated statement
of financial condition as of November 1998.

     Substantially all financial instruments used in the firm's trading and
nontrading activities are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair
value, and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings. Fair value is
based generally on listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. To
the extent that prices are not readily available, or if liquidating the firm's
position is reasonably expected to affect market prices, fair value is based on
either internal valuation models or management's estimate of amounts that could
be realized under current market conditions, assuming an orderly liquidation
over a reasonable period of time. Certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivative
instruments are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors,
current and contractual market prices, time value, and yield curve and/or
volatility factors of the underlying positions. The fair value of the firm's
trading and nontrading assets and liabilities is discussed further in Notes 3, 4
and 5.

  PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

     Principal investments are carried at fair value, generally based upon
quoted market prices or comparable substantial third-party transactions. Where
fair value is not readily ascertainable, principal investments are recorded at
cost or management's estimate of the realizable value.

     The firm is entitled to receive merchant banking overrides (i.e., an
increased share of a fund's income and gains) when the return on the fund's
investments exceeds certain threshold returns. Overrides are based on investment
performance over the life of each merchant banking fund, and future investment
underperformance may require amounts previously distributed to the firm to be
returned to the funds. Accordingly, overrides are recognized in earnings only
when management determines that the probability of return is remote. Overrides
are included in "Asset management and securities services" on the consolidated
statements of earnings.

  DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

     Derivatives used for trading purposes are reported at fair value and are
included in "Derivative contracts" on the consolidated statements of financial
condition. Gains and losses on derivatives used for trading purposes are
generally included in "Trading and principal investments" on the consolidated
statements of earnings.

     Derivatives used for nontrading purposes include interest rate futures
contracts and interest rate and currency swap agreements, which are primarily
utilized to convert a substantial portion of the firm's fixed rate debt into
U.S. dollar-based floating rate obligations. Gains and losses on these
derivatives are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest
expense over the life of the derivative contract. Gains and losses resulting
from the early termination of derivatives used for nontrading purposes are
generally deferred and recognized over the remaining life of the underlying
debt. If the underlying debt is terminated prior to its stated maturity, gains
and losses on these transactions, including the associated hedges, are
recognized in earnings immediately.

     Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis on the consolidated
statements of financial condition where management believes a legal right of
setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement.

  PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT

     Depreciation and amortization generally are computed using accelerated cost
recovery methods for all property and equipment and for leasehold improvements
where the term of the lease is greater than the economic useful life of the
asset. All other leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease.

                                       53

<PAGE>   9

  GOODWILL

     The cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets at
acquisition date is recorded as goodwill and amortized over periods of 15 to 20
years on a straight-line basis.

  INVESTMENT BANKING

     Underwriting revenues and fees from mergers and acquisitions and other
corporate finance advisory assignments are recorded when the underlying
transaction is completed under the terms of the engagement. Syndicate expenses
related to securities offerings in which the firm acts as an underwriter or
agent are deferred until the related revenue is recognized.

  EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Earnings per share (EPS) is computed in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." Basic EPS
is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Common shares outstanding includes common stock and
nonvoting common stock as well as restricted stock units for which no future
service is required as a condition to the delivery of the underlying common
stock. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition,
reflects the dilutive effect of common stock deliverable pursuant to the
restricted stock units and stock options for which future service is required as
a condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock.

  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     The firm has elected to account for stock-based employee compensation plans
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees," as permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation." In accordance with APB No. 25, compensation expense
is not recognized for stock options that have no intrinsic value on the date of
grant. Compensation expense is recognized immediately for restricted stock units
for which future service is not required as a condition to the delivery of the
underlying shares of common stock. For restricted stock units with future
service requirements, compensation expense is recognized over the relevant
vesting period using an accelerated amortization methodology.

  INCOME TAXES

     The firm accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of tax benefits or
expenses on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of its assets and liabilities. As a partnership, the firm was primarily
subject to unincorporated business taxes and taxes in foreign jurisdictions on
certain of its operations. As a corporation, the earnings of the firm are
subject to U.S. federal, foreign, state and local taxes. As a result of its
conversion to corporate form, the firm recognized the tax effect of the change
in its income tax rate on both its deferred tax assets and liabilities and the
earnings attributable to the period from May 7, 1999 to the end of the fiscal
year. The firm's tax assets and liabilities are presented as a component of
"Other assets" and "Other liabilities and accrued expenses," respectively, on
the consolidated statements of financial condition.

  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

     Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at
rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the statement of financial
condition, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange
for the fiscal year. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements
of a non-U.S. operation, where the functional currency is other than the U.S.
dollar, are reflected as a separate component of equity. Gains or losses on
foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of
earnings.

     As a partnership, the firm reported the cumulative translation adjustment
as a component of "Partners' capital allocated for income taxes and potential
withdrawals" on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Effective
with the firm's conversion to corporate form, the cumulative translation
adjustment is reported as "Accumulated other comprehensive income" on the
consolidated statement of financial condition.

  ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

     In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 137,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 -- an amendment of FASB Statement No.
133," which deferred to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 the effective
date of the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively, referred to as
derivatives), and for hedging activities. This Statement requires that an entity
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value. The accounting
for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on its intended
use and the resulting designation. The firm intends to adopt the provisions of
SFAS No. 133 deferred by SFAS No. 137 in fiscal 2001 and is currently assessing
their effect.

     In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) No.
98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. SOP
No. 98-1 requires that certain costs of computer software developed or obtained
for internal use be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the
related software. The firm previously expensed the cost of all software
development in the period it was incurred. The adoption of SOP No. 98-1 is not
expected to have a material effect on the firm's results of operations or
financial condition. The firm intends to adopt the provisions of SOP No. 98-1 in
fiscal 2000.

NOTE 3/FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     Financial instruments, including both cash instruments and derivatives, are
used to manage market risk, facilitate customer transactions, engage in
proprietary transactions and meet financing objectives. These instruments can be
either executed on an exchange or negotiated in the OTC market.

     Transactions involving financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased,
entail an obligation to purchase a financial instrument at a future date. The
firm may incur a loss if the market value of the financial instrument
subsequently increases prior to the purchase of the instrument.

  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     Substantially all of the firm's assets and liabilities are carried at fair
value or amounts that approximate fair value.

     Trading assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts used for
trading purposes, are carried at fair value and reported as financial
instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, on the
consolidated statements of financial condition. Nontrading assets and
liabilities are generally carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair
value.

     Nontrading assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and securities
segregated in compliance with U.S. federal and other regulations; receivables
from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations; receivables from customers and
counterparties; securities borrowed; securities purchased under agreements to
resell; right to receive securities; and certain investments, primarily those
made in connection with the firm's merchant banking activities.

     Nontrading liabilities include short-term borrowings; payables to brokers,
dealers and clearing organizations; payables to customers and counterparties;
securities loaned; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; obligation to
return securities; other liabilities and accrued expenses; and long-term
borrowings. The fair value of the firm's long-term borrowings and associated
hedges is discussed in Note 5.

  TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

     The firm's Trading and Principal Investments business, a component of the
Global Capital Markets segment, facilitates customer transactions and takes
proprietary positions through market making in and trading of securities,
currencies, commodities and swaps, and other derivatives. Derivative financial
instruments are often used to hedge cash instruments or other derivative
financial instruments as an integral part of the firm's strategies. As a result,
it is necessary to view the results of any activity on a fully integrated basis,
including cash positions, the

                                       55

<PAGE>   11
effect of related derivatives and the financing of the underlying positions.

     Net revenues include allocations of interest income and expense to specific
securities, commodities and other positions in relation to the cash generated
by, or funding requirements of, the underlying positions.

     The following table sets forth the net revenues of Trading and Principal
Investments:

</TABLE>

  RISK MANAGEMENT

     The firm seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a variety
of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational and legal reporting
systems. Management believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and
managing the market, credit and other risks to which it is exposed. The
Management Committee, the firm's primary decision-making body, determines (both
directly and through delegated authority) the types of business in which the
firm engages, approves guidelines for accepting customers for all product lines,
outlines the terms under which customer business is conducted and establishes
the parameters for the risks that the firm is willing to undertake in its
business.

     The Firmwide Risk Committee, which reports to senior management and meets
weekly, is responsible for managing and monitoring all of the firm's risk
exposures. In addition, the firm maintains segregation of duties, with credit
review and risk-monitoring functions performed by groups that are independent
from revenue-producing departments.

     MARKET RISK.  The potential for changes in the market value of the firm's
trading positions is referred to as "market risk." The firm's trading positions
result from underwriting, market-making and proprietary trading activities.

     Categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates, currency
rates, equity prices and commodity prices. A description of each market risk
category is set forth below:

     - Interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the
       level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest
       rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads.

     - Currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices,
       forward prices and volatilities of currency rates.

     - Equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and
       volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and equity indices.

     - Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices,
       forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as electricity,
       natural gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and precious and base metals.

     These risk exposures are managed through diversification, by controlling
position sizes and by establishing hedges in related securities or derivatives.
For example, the firm may hedge a portfolio of common stock by taking an
offsetting position in a related equity-index futures contract. The ability to
manage these exposures may, however, be limited by adverse changes in the
liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation
of price movements between the security and the related hedge instrument.

     CREDIT RISK.  Credit risk represents the loss that the firm would incur if
a counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by the firm
fails to perform its contractual obligations to the firm. To reduce credit
exposures, the firm seeks to enter into netting agreements with counterparties
that permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such
counterparties. In addition, the firm attempts to further reduce credit risk by
entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a
counterparty, to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified
time periods or upon the occurrence of credit-related events, by seeking
third-party guarantees of the counterparty's obligations, and through the use of
credit derivatives.

     Credit concentrations may arise from trading, underwriting and securities
borrowing activities and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or
political factors. The firm's concentration of credit risk is monitored actively
by the Credit Policy Committee. As of

                                       56

<PAGE>   12
November 1999 and 1998, U.S. government and federal agency obligations
represented 7% of the firm's total assets. In addition, most of the firm's
securities purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized by U.S.
government, federal agency and other sovereign obligations.

  DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES

     Most of the firm's derivative transactions are entered into for trading
purposes. The firm uses derivatives in its trading activities to facilitate
customer transactions, to take proprietary positions and as a means of risk
management. The firm also enters into nontrading derivative contracts to manage
the interest rate and currency exposure on its long-term borrowings. Nontrading
derivatives related to the firm's long-term borrowings are discussed in Note 5.

     Derivative contracts are financial instruments, such as futures, forwards,
swaps or option contracts, that derive their value from underlying assets,
indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may
involve future commitments to purchase or sell financial instruments or
commodities, or to exchange currency or interest payment streams. The amounts
exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to
specified rates, securities, commodities or indices.

     Derivative contracts exclude certain cash instruments, such as
mortgage-backed securities, interest-only and principal-only obligations, and
indexed debt instruments, that derive their values or contractually required
cash flows from the price of some other security or index. Derivatives also
exclude option features that are embedded in cash instruments, such as the
conversion features and call provisions embedded in bonds. The firm has elected
to include commodity-related contracts in its derivative disclosure, although
not required to do so, as these contracts may be settled in cash or are readily
convertible into cash.

     The gross notional (or contractual) amounts of derivative financial
instruments represent the volume of these transactions and not the amounts
potentially subject to market risk. In addition, measurement of market risk is
meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are taken into
consideration.

     Gross notional (or contractual) amounts of derivative financial instruments
used for trading purposes with off-balance-sheet market risk are set forth
below:

     Market risk on purchased option contracts is limited to the market value of
the option; therefore, purchased option contracts have no off-balance-sheet
market risk.

     The firm utilizes replacement cost as a measure of derivative credit risk.
Replacement cost, as reported in "Financial instruments owned, at fair value" on
the consolidated statements of financial condition, represents amounts
receivable from various counterparties, net of any unrealized losses, owed where
management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting
agreement. Replacement cost for purchased option contracts is the market value
of the contract. The firm controls its credit risk through an established credit
approval process, by monitoring counterparty limits, obtaining collateral where
appropriate and, in some cases, entering into enforceable netting agreements.

     The fair value of derivative financial instruments used for trading
purposes, computed in accordance with the firm's netting policy, is set forth
below:

NOTE 4/SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

     The firm obtains secured short-term financing principally through the use
of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements, collateralized
mainly by U.S. government, federal agency, investment-grade foreign sovereign
obligations and equity securities. The firm obtains unsecured short-term
borrowings through issuance of commercial paper, promissory notes and bank
loans. The carrying value of these short-term obligations approximates fair
value due to their short-term nature.

     Short-term borrowings are set forth below:

    from 0.85% to 9.51% and from 1.90% to 9.51%, respectively.

(2) Floating interest rates generally are based on LIBOR, the U.S. treasury bill
    rate or the federal funds rate. Certain equity-linked and indexed
    instruments are included in floating rate obligations.

(3) Long-term borrowings bear fixed or floating interest rates and have
    maturities that range from one to 30 years from the date of issue.

     The firm enters into nontrading derivative contracts, such as interest rate
and currency swap agreements, to effectively convert a substantial portion of
its fixed rate long-term borrowings into U.S. dollar-based floating rate
obligations. Accordingly, the aggregate carrying value of these long-term
borrowings and related hedges approximates fair value.

     The effective weighted average interest rates for long-term borrowings,
after hedging activities, are set forth below:

NOTE 6/COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  LITIGATION

     The firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration
proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its
businesses. Management believes, based on currently available information, that
the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material
adverse effect on the firm's financial condition, but might be material to the
firm's operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the
operating results for such period.

  LEASES

     The firm has obligations under long-term noncancelable lease agreements,
principally for office space, expiring on various dates through 2019. Certain
agreements are subject to periodic escalation charges for increases in real
estate taxes and other charges. Minimum rental commitments, net of minimum
sublease rentals, under noncancelable leases for 2000 and the succeeding four
years and thereafter and rent charged to operating expense for the last three
years are set forth below:

  OTHER COMMITMENTS

     The firm acts as an investor in merchant banking transactions, which
includes making long-term investments in equity and debt securities in privately
negotiated transactions, corporate acquisitions and real estate transactions. In
connection with these activities, the firm had commitments to invest up to $1.09
billion and $1.39 billion in corporate and real estate merchant banking
investment funds and a bridge loan fund as of November 1999 and November 1998,
respectively.

     In connection with loan origination and participation, the firm had loan
commitments of $9.38 billion and $1.51 billion as of November 1999 and November
1998, respectively. These commitments are agreements to lend to counterparties,
have fixed termination dates and are contingent on all conditions to borrowing
set forth in the contract having been met. Since these commitments may expire
unused, the total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect the actual
future cash flow requirements.

     The firm also had outstanding guarantees of $575 million and $790 million
relating to its fund management activities as of November 1999 and November
1998, respectively.

     The firm had pledged securities of $35.83 billion and $22.88 billion as
collateral for securities borrowed of approximately equivalent value as of
November 1999 and November 1998, respectively.

     The firm had commitments to enter into repurchase and resale agreements of
$30.58 billion and $46.26 billion as of November 1999 and November 1998,
respectively.

     The firm provides letters of credit issued by various banks to
counterparties in lieu of securities or cash to satisfy various collateral and
margin deposit requirements. Letters of credit outstanding were $10.30 billion
and $8.81 billion as of November 1999 and November 1998, respectively.

NOTE 7/EQUITY CAPITAL

     On May 7, 1999, the firm converted from a partnership to a corporation and
completed its initial public offering. In that offering, the firm sold
51,000,000 shares of common stock. In addition, the firm completed a number of
transactions to have Group Inc. succeed to the business of The Goldman Sachs
Group, L.P. These transactions included the exchange of the partnership
interests of the participating limited partners (PLPs), retired limited
partners, Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets, Inc. and Kamehameha Activities
Association for shares of common stock. As of November 1999, the firm had equity
of $10.15 billion.

     Shares of nonvoting common stock are convertible into shares of common
stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer by Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets,
Inc., the beneficial owner of such shares as of November 1999, to a third party,
and in certain other circumstances.

     As of November 1998, the firm had $6.31 billion in partners' capital, which
included both the general partner's and limited partners' capital. Partners'
capital allocated for income taxes and potential withdrawals represented
management's estimate of net amounts distributable, primarily to the PLPs, under
the Partnership Agreement, for items including, among other things, income taxes
and capital withdrawals.

NOTE 9/EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The firm sponsors various pension plans and certain other postretirement
benefit plans, primarily healthcare and life insurance, which cover most
employees worldwide. The firm also provides certain benefits to former or
inactive employees prior to retirement. A summary of these plans is set forth
below:

  DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

     The firm maintains a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all
U.S. employees. Employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries participate in
various local defined benefit plans. These plans generally provide benefits
based on years of credited service and a percentage of the employee's eligible
compensation. In addition, the firm has unfunded postretirement benefit plans
that provide medical and life insurance for eligible retirees, employees and
dependents in the United States.

     For plans in which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded plan assets,
the projected benefit obligation and aggregate accumulated benefit obligation
was $138 million and $121 million as of November 1999, respectively, and $85
million and $85 million as of November 1998, respectively. The fair value of
plan assets for these plans was $110 million and $57 million as of November 1999
and November 1998, respectively. For plans in which the accumulated benefit
obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets, the effect of recognizing
this amount would not have been material to the consolidated statements of
financial condition or comprehensive income.

     For measurement purposes, a 6.6% annual rate of increase in the per capita
cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for the fiscal year ending

year ending November 2008 and remain at that level thereafter.

  DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

     The firm contributes to employer-sponsored U.S. and international defined
contribution plans. The firm's contribution to these plans was $94 million, $70
million and $68 million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     The firm has also established a nonqualified defined contribution plan (the
Plan) for certain senior employees. Shares of common stock contributed to the
Plan in 1999 and outstanding as of November 1999 were 12,660,685. The shares of
common stock will vest and generally be distributable to the participant on
specified future dates if the participant satisfies certain conditions and the
participant's employment with the firm has not been terminated, with certain
exceptions for terminations of employment due to death or a change in control.
Dividends on the underlying shares of common stock are paid currently to the
participants. Forfeited shares remain in the Plan and are reallocated to other
participants. Contributions to the Plan are expensed on the date of grant. Plan
expense in 1999 was $674 million, including $666 million granted in connection
with the firm's initial public offering.


NOTE 10/EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

     The firm sponsors a stock incentive plan that provides for grants of
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
dividend equivalent rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other
stock-based awards. The stock incentive plan also permits the making of loans to
purchase shares of common stock.

     The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the
stock incentive plan through fiscal 2002 may not exceed 300,000,000 shares and,
in each fiscal year thereafter, may not exceed 5% of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, determined as of the last day of the immediately
preceding fiscal year, increased by the number of shares available for awards in
previous fiscal years but not covered by awards granted in such years. As of
November 1999, 183,440,631 shares were available for grant under the stock
incentive plan.

  RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

     The firm issued restricted stock units to employees in 1999 under the stock
incentive plan, primarily in connection with its initial public offering and as
part of year-end compensation. Of the total restricted stock units outstanding
as of November 1999, (i) 40,344,481 units required future service as a condition
to the delivery of the underlying shares of common stock, and (ii) 35,703,923
units did not require future service. In all cases, delivery of the underlying
shares of common stock is conditioned on the grantee's satisfying certain other
requirements outlined in the award agreements.

  STOCK OPTIONS

     Stock options granted to employees during 1999 will generally become
exercisable in equal installments on or about the third, fourth and fifth
anniversaries of the date of grant if the grantee has satisfied certain
conditions and the grantee's employment with the firm has not been terminated,
with certain exceptions for terminations of employment due to death, retirement,
extended absence or a change in control. Once service requirements have been
met, these options will generally remain exercisable, subject to satisfaction of
certain conditions, until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Pursuant
to APB No. 25, compensation expense was not recognized for those options that
had no intrinsic value on the date of grant. The dilutive effect of these
options is included in diluted common shares outstanding under SFAS No. 128.

     The activity of these stock options during 1999 is set forth below:

  PRO FORMA EFFECT OF SFAS NO. 123

     If the firm were to recognize compensation expense under the fair
value-based method of SFAS No. 123 with respect to options granted, net earnings
would have decreased resulting in pro forma net earnings and EPS as follows:

grants is recognized over the relevant vesting period. The effect of applying
SFAS No. 123 in the pro forma disclosure above is not representative of the
potential pro forma effect on net earnings in future periods.

NOTE 11/INCOME TAXES

     Prior to its conversion to corporate form, the firm operated as a
partnership and generally was not subject to U.S. federal and state income
taxes. The earnings of the firm, however, were subject to local unincorporated
business taxes. In addition, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries were subject to
income taxes in their local jurisdictions. The partners of the firm's
predecessor partnership were taxed on their proportionate share of the
partnership's taxable income or loss. Effective with the conversion from a
partnership to a corporation on May 7, 1999, the firm became subject to U.S.
federal, state and local corporate income taxes.

</TABLE>

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These
temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years
and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such
differences are expected to reverse. In connection with the conversion from a
partnership to a corporation, the firm recognized a deferred tax benefit related
to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets recorded as a partnership.
Additionally, deferred tax assets were recorded as a result of acquisitions
during 1999.

     Significant components of the firm's deferred tax assets and liabilities
are set forth below:

</TABLE>

- ---------------
(1) The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is not applicable to 1998 or 1997
    because the firm operated as a partnership and generally was not subject to
    corporate federal income taxes. U.S. federal taxes paid by subsidiary
    corporations are included in "Other" for 1998 and 1997.

(2) The deferred tax benefit recognized upon the firm's change in tax status
    from partnership to corporate form primarily reflects the revaluation of the
    deferred tax assets and liabilities at the firm's corporate income tax rate.

(3) The rate benefit for the partnership period relates to the firm's earnings
    prior to its conversion to corporate form, which generally were not subject
    to corporate income taxes.

NOTE 12/REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

     GS&Co. is a registered U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, which is subject to
the Securities and Exchange Commission's "Uniform Net Capital Rule," and has
elected to compute its net capital in accordance with the "Alternative Net
Capital Requirement" of that rule. As of November 1999 and November 1998, GS&Co.
had regulatory net capital, as defined, of $2.92 billion and $3.25 billion,
respectively, which exceeded the amounts required by $2.31 billion and $2.70
billion, respectively.

     GSI, a registered U.K. broker-dealer and subsidiary of Group Inc., is
subject to the capital requirements of the Securities and Futures Authority
Limited, and GSJL, a Tokyo-based broker-dealer, is subject to the capital
requirements of the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Financial Supervisory
Agency. As of November 1999 and November 1998, GSI and GSJL were in compliance
with their local capital adequacy requirements.

     Certain other subsidiaries of the firm are also subject to capital adequacy
requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate.
As of November 1999 and November 1998, these subsidiaries were in compliance
with their local capital adequacy requirements.

NOTE 13/BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     In reporting to management, the firm's operating results are categorized
into the following two principal segments: Global Capital Markets; and Asset
Management and Securities Services.

GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS

     The Global Capital Markets segment includes services related to the
following:

     INVESTMENT BANKING.  The firm provides a broad range of investment banking
services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments
and individuals. The firm's investment banking activities are divided into two
categories:

     - FINANCIAL ADVISORY.  Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments
       with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense
       activities, restructurings and spin-offs; and

     - UNDERWRITING.  Underwriting includes public offerings and private
       placements of equity and debt securities.



                                       69
<PAGE>   25
     TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.  The firm's Trading and Principal
Investments business facilitates transactions with a diverse group of
corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and takes
proprietary positions through market making in and trading of fixed income and
equity products, currencies, commodities, and swaps and other derivatives.
Trading and Principal Investments is divided into three categories:

     - FICC. The firm makes markets in and trades fixed income products,
       currencies and commodities, structures and enters into a wide variety of
       derivative transactions, and engages in proprietary trading and arbitrage
       activities;

     - EQUITIES.  The firm makes markets in and trades equities and
       equity-related products, structures and enters into equity derivative
       transactions, and engages in proprietary trading and equity arbitrage;
       and

     - PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.  Principal Investments primarily represents net
       revenues from the firm's merchant banking investments.

ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

     The Asset Management and Securities Services segment includes services
related to the following:

     - ASSET MANAGEMENT.  Asset Management generates management fees by
       providing investment advisory services to a diverse client base of
       institutions and individuals;

     - SECURITIES SERVICES.  Securities Services includes prime brokerage,
       financing services and securities lending and the firm's matched book
       businesses, all of which generate revenue primarily in the form of fees
       or interest rate spreads; and

     - COMMISSIONS.  Commissions include agency transactions for clients on
       major stock and futures exchanges and revenues from the increased share
       of the income and gains derived from the firm's merchant banking funds.

  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     In reporting segments, certain of the firm's business lines have been
aggregated where they have similar economic characteristics and are similar in
each of the following areas: (i) the nature of the services they provide, (ii)
their methods of distribution, (iii) the types of clients they serve and (iv)
the regulatory environments in which they operate.

     The firm allocates revenues and expenses between the two segments. Due to
the integrated nature of the business segments, estimates and judgments have
been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between
segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. Total
operating expenses include corporate items that have not been allocated to
either business segment. The allocation process is based on the manner in which
management views the business of the firm.

     The segment information presented in the table below is prepared according
to the following methodologies:

     - Revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included
       in determining pre-tax earnings.

     - Net revenues in the firm's segments include allocations of interest
       income and expense to specific securities, commodities and other
       positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements
       of, the underlying positions. Net interest is allocated to the Trading
       and Principal Investments component of Global Capital Markets and the
       Securities Services component of Asset Management and Securities
       Services. Net interest is included within segment net revenues as it is
       consistent with the way in which management assesses segment performance.

     - Overhead expenses not directly allocable to specific segments are
       allocated ratably based on direct segment expenses.

     - The nonrecurring expenses associated with the firm's conversion to
       corporate form and related transactions are not allocated to individual
       segments as management excludes them in evaluating segment performance.

(3) The pre-tax earnings of the firm's segments in 1999 reflect payments for
    services rendered by managing directors who, prior to the firm's conversion
    to corporate form, were profit participating limited partners. In prior
    years, these payments were accounted for as distributions of partners'
    capital rather than as compensation and benefits expense. As a result, these
    payments are not reflected in the operating expenses of the firm's segments
    in 1998 and 1997 and, therefore, the pre-tax earnings of the firm's segments
    in these years are not comparable with 1999.

(4) Includes deferred tax assets relating to the firm's conversion to corporate
    form and certain other assets that management believes are not allocable to
    a particular segment.

(5) Includes the following expenses that have not been allocated to the firm's
    segments: (i) nonrecurring employee initial public offering awards of $2.26
    billion, (ii) the ongoing amortization of employee initial public offering
    awards of $268 million and (iii) the charitable contribution to The Goldman
    Sachs Foundation of $200 million made at the time of the firm's initial
    public offering.

  GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

     Due to the highly integrated nature of international financial markets, the
firm manages its businesses based on the profitability of the enterprise as a
whole. Accordingly, management believes that profitability by geographic region
is not necessarily meaningful.

     The firm's revenues, expenses and identifiable assets are generally
allocated based on the country of domicile of the legal entity providing the
service.

The following are significant subsidiaries of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as
of November 26, 1999 and the states or jurisdictions in which they are
organized. Indentation indicates the principal parent of each subsidiary. Except
as otherwise specified, in each case The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. owns,
directly or indirectly, at least 99% of the voting securities of each

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

                         ----------------------------

To the Directors and Shareholders,
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of The Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "firm") as of November 26, 1999 and November
27, 1998, and for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended November
26, 1999 and have issued our report thereon, which expresses an unqualified
opinion, dated January 21, 2000. Such consolidated statements and our report
thereon are incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We have also previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated statements of financial condition as of November
28, 1997, November 29, 1996 and November 24, 1995, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, changes in partners' capital and cash flows for the
years ended November 29, 1996 and November 24, 1995 (none of which are
presented herein); and we expressed unqualified opinions on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the selected
consolidated financial data for each of the five years in the period ended
November 26, 1999, appearing on pages 25 to 26 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived.
