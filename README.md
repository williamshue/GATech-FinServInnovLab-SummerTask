1. I installed SEC Edgar Downloader via pip: https://sec-edgar-downloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
2. I read through the documentation and identified how to use it to download 10-K filings, for a specific ticker, over a specific time period.
3. I wrote sec_10k_fetcher.py to do this for Berkshire Hathway A Class Shares, Goladman Sachs (which IPOed in 1999) and Morgan Stanley
